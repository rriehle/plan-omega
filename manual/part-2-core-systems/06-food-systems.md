## Introduction

After water, food is the most critical survival resource. While humans can survive 3 weeks without food, performance and health degrade quickly. This chapter provides a comprehensive P.A.C.E. approach to food procurement, storage, and preservation for long-term maritime autonomy.

## Food Requirements

### Caloric Needs
- Active adult: 2,500-3,500 kcal/day
- Adult (moderate activity): 2,000-2,500 kcal/day
- Child (varies by age): 1,200-2,200 kcal/day
- Family of 4 average: ~9,000 kcal/day

### Nutritional Balance
- Carbohydrates: 45-65% of calories
- Protein: 10-35% of calories (minimum 50g/day/adult)
- Fat: 20-35% of calories
- Vitamins and minerals (prevent deficiency diseases)

### Storage Targets
- **Minimum**: 90 days at full rations
- **Recommended**: 12 months at full rations
- **Ideal**: 18-24 months + renewable food sources

## P.A.C.E. Food Plan

### PRIMARY: Long-Term Stored Provisions

**Description:** Shelf-stable foods purchased and stored aboard

**Best foods for boat storage:**
- Rice (white rice: 30+ years if stored properly)
- Beans and lentils (dried: 10+ years)
- Pasta (5-10 years)
- Canned goods (2-5 years, longer if cool/dry)
- Freeze-dried meals (25+ years)
- Flour (1-2 years, longer if frozen/vacuum sealed)
- Sugar, salt (indefinite)
- Cooking oil (1-2 years)
- Powdered milk (2-10 years)
- Nuts and seeds (1-2 years)

**Storage requirements:**
- Cool, dry, dark location
- Pest-proof containers
- Organization (FIFO: first in, first out)
- Inventory tracking
- Rotation system

**Calculation example (1 year for family of 4):**
- Rice: 300 kg (660 lbs)
- Beans/lentils: 150 kg (330 lbs)
- Canned goods: 500+ cans
- Freeze-dried meals: 100+ meals
- Etc.

*[To be expanded: detailed provisioning lists, storage methods, rotation schedules, preservation techniques]*

### ALTERNATE: Fishing and Seafood Harvesting

**Description:** Renewable food from the ocean

**Methods:**
- Trolling (while sailing)
- Bottom fishing (at anchor)
- Spearfishing (where legal)
- Shellfish/lobster (coastal)
- Nets and traps

**Equipment:**
- Trolling lures and lines
- Bottom fishing tackle
- Speargun and snorkel/freediving gear
- Cast net
- Fish processing tools (fillet knife, cutting board, etc.)

**Species targeting:**
- Pelagic fish (tuna, mahi-mahi, wahoo)
- Bottom fish (snapper, grouper, etc.)
- Squid and octopus
- Shellfish (mussels, clams, lobster)

**Processing and preservation:**
- Immediate consumption
- Refrigeration (short-term)
- Freezing (if power available)
- Salting/drying (long-term without power)
- Smoking
- Canning (pressure canner needed)

*[To be expanded: fishing techniques, gear lists, preservation methods, safety considerations]*

---

### CONTINGENCY: Foraging and Local Trade

**Description:** Land-based food sources when in port or at anchor near land

**Foraging:**
- Coconuts (ubiquitous in tropics)
- Tropical fruits (breadfruit, papaya, mango, etc.)
- Wild greens and vegetables
- Shellfish and intertidal gathering

**Local trade/barter:**
- Skills (boat repair, medical, education)
- Goods (fishing gear, tools, manufactured items)
- Cash (if local economy functions)
- Fresh local produce and protein

**Growing food aboard:**
- Sprouts (fast, nutritious)
- Microgreens
- Small container gardens (herbs, cherry tomatoes)
- Limited by space and freshwater

*[To be expanded: edible plant guides by region, barter strategies, aquaponics options]*

---

### EMERGENCY: Survival Rations and Starvation Management

**Description:** When all other food sources fail

**Emergency rations:**
- Liferaft rations (high-calorie bars, 5-year shelf life)
- Store 30+ days minimum
- Multiple locations (liferaft, abandon ship bag, emergency cache)

**Starvation management:**
- Rationing protocols (reduced calories)
- Prioritization (children first, then nursing/pregnant women, then adults)
- Edible resources aboard (leather, non-toxic materials - truly desperate)
- Medical management of starvation (refeeding syndrome awareness)

*[To be expanded: rationing math, starvation physiology, refeeding protocols]*

---

## Special Dietary Considerations

### Nutritional Deficiencies to Prevent
- **Scurvy** (vitamin C): Citrus, sprouts, some fish
- **Beriberi** (vitamin B1/thiamine): Whole grains, beans, nuts
- **Pellagra** (niacin/B3): Meat, fish, peanuts
- **Protein deficiency**: Beans + rice = complete protein
- **Omega-3**: Fish, flaxseed, walnuts
- **Calcium**: Canned fish with bones, powdered milk

### Supplements
- Multivitamins (2-year supply minimum)
- Vitamin C (critical)
- Vitamin D (if limited sun exposure)
- Omega-3 (fish oil)

### Medical Diets
- Diabetes: Low/controlled carb options
- Allergies: Avoid allergens, ensure alternatives
- Infant formula: If nursing not possible, stockpile
