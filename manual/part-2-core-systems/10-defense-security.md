## Introduction

Security threats—piracy, theft, boarding, violence—can end your survival instantly. This chapter addresses threat avoidance, deterrence, active defense, and evasion using a layered P.A.C.E. approach that prioritizes avoiding conflict while maintaining capability to defend if necessary.

**CRITICAL NOTE**: This chapter focuses on defensive security only—protecting your family from threats. Always comply with applicable laws regarding weapons, use of force, and self-defense.

## Threat Assessment

### Types of Threats
- **Piracy**: Armed boarding for theft or kidnapping (specific high-risk regions)
- **Opportunistic theft**: Dinghy theft, stealing from boat, petty crime
- **Robbery**: Confrontational theft (potentially violent)
- **Harassment**: Aggressive begging, intimidation
- **State actors**: Corrupt officials, military, coast guard
- **Desperate refugees**: Climate/economic refugees seeking resources
- **Other cruisers**: In collapse scenario, even cruisers may become threats

### High-Risk Regions (current, subject to change)
- Somali coast and Gulf of Aden
- Parts of Southeast Asia (Malacca Strait, etc.)
- West Africa (Nigeria, Cameroon)
- Parts of Caribbean and Central America
- Failed states and conflict zones

*In collapse scenarios, risk areas may expand dramatically.*

## P.A.C.E. Security Plan

### PRIMARY: Avoidance and Evasion

**Description:** Don't be where threats are; don't be a target

**Avoidance strategies:**
- **Intelligence**: Monitor security reports (noonsite, SSCA, cruiser forums, piracy maps)
- **Route planning**: Avoid known high-risk areas
- **Timing**: Transit risky areas during safe periods (convoys, naval escorts if available)
- **Positioning**: Anchor in safe, visible, populated (but not dangerous) areas
- **Low profile**: Don't appear wealthy, don't flash valuables, modest boat

**Evasion tactics:**
- **Speed**: Maintain ability to outrun threats (sailing fast, engine ready)
- **Night passages**: Through risky areas (less visible, harder to approach)
- **Radar watch**: Detect approaching vessels early
- **AIS**: Monitor for suspicious traffic (also can turn yours off to be less visible)
- **Maneuverability**: Ready to change course, flee

**Operational security:**
- Limit information sharing (don't broadcast plans widely)
- VHF discipline (others listening)
- Social media blackout (don't post real-time location)
- Blend in (don't stand out)

*[To be expanded: intelligence sources, risk assessment, route planning for security]*

### ALTERNATE: Deterrence and Hardening

**Description:** Make your boat a hard target; discourage attempts

**Visible deterrents:**
- **Watch routine**: Always someone visible on deck at anchor
- **Lights**: Bright cockpit/deck lights (show you're awake and alert)
- **Radio communication**: Respond to hails, participate in nets (show you're connected)
- **Dog**: If feasible, visible/audible dog (serious deterrent)
- **Crew**: Multiple adults visible (strength in numbers)

**Hardening measures:**
- **Lockable companionway**: Strong hatch, inside lock/bar
- **Reinforced hatches**: Prevent forced entry
- **Secured dinghy**: Lock cable, lift at night, or bring aboard
- **Valuables hidden**: No visible expensive electronics, gear
- **Anchor alarm**: GPS-based alarm for dragging or movement (someone moving boat)

**Communication:**
- **VHF**: Channel 16 monitored, call for help
- **SSB/Ham radio**: Long-range communication
- **Satellite**: Inreach, Iridium (text for help)
- **EPIRB**: Extreme emergency (life-threatening)

**Passive resistance:**
- **Delay**: Slow down intruder (locked hatches, obstacles)
- **Alarm**: Loud noise (air horn, alarm) to attract attention and scare
- **Surrender valuables**: Have decoy cash/electronics to hand over (avoid escalation)

*[To be expanded: hardening techniques, deterrent installations, communication protocols]*

### CONTINGENCY: Active Defense (Non-Lethal and Lethal)

**Description:** Defend yourself and family when avoidance and deterrence fail

**IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTE**: Weapons laws vary by country. Research and comply with laws in every jurisdiction you visit. Illegal weapons can result in seizure, imprisonment, and boat confiscation. Many cruisers navigate without firearms successfully.

**Non-lethal options:**
- **Flare guns**: Handheld, 12-gauge, very effective deterrent (fire, noise, danger)
- **Fire extinguisher**: Spray in face (disorienting, painful)
- **Wasp spray**: Long range, painful, temporarily disabling
- **Air horn**: Loud, disorienting, draws attention
- **Bright spotlight**: Blind attackers, signal for help
- **Physical barriers**: Gates, netting (prevent boarding)

**Improvised weapons:**
- **Boat hook**: Repel boarders
- **Winch handle**: Impact weapon
- **Flares**: Incendiary, intimidating
- **Knife**: Last resort, close quarters

**Firearms** (if legal and you choose to carry):

**Handguns:**
- Compact, maneuverable in close quarters
- 9mm or .38 common
- Training essential

**Shotguns:**
- 12-gauge, effective deterrent and defense
- Less precision needed at close range
- Intimidating sound

**Rifles:**
- Range (if defending against approach)
- Hunting (food procurement dual-use)

**Considerations:**
- **Training**: Firearms without training are dangerous to user
- **Storage**: Secure (children, thieves, corrosion)
- **Legal**: Declare, or hide (risk of severe consequences)
- **Ammunition**: Adequate supply, protected from corrosion
- **Maintenance**: Prevent rust, function test regularly

**Rules of engagement (personal decision):**
- **Verbal warning**: If possible, warn intruders off
- **Warning shots**: Fire away from threat (demonstration)
- **Defensive force**: Only if life threatened, proportional response
- **De-escalation**: Always preferable if possible

*[To be expanded: weapon selection, training requirements, legal navigation, rules of engagement]*

### EMERGENCY: Escape and Abandon

**Description:** When all else fails, flee the vessel

**Scenarios for abandonment:**
- Armed boarding imminent, family safety at risk
- Fire or flooding uncontrollable (see Shelter chapter)
- Vessel seizure by hostile forces

**Escape options:**
- **Dinghy**: Flee to shore or another vessel
- **Liferaft**: Deploy if no better option
- **Swim**: Last resort, only if close to safe shore
- **Surrender**: Comply with demands, preserve life (things can be replaced, life cannot)

**Escape preparation:**
- **Abandon ship bag**: Always ready (documents, cash, water, comm device)
- **Dinghy ready**: Fueled, operational, accessible
- **Escape plan**: Practiced with family
- **Rally point**: Pre-determined meeting point if separated

**Prioritize:**
1. Life (family safety above all)
2. Documents (passports, papers)
3. Communication (radio, phone, EPIRB)
4. Essentials (water, first aid)
5. Nothing else matters

*[To be expanded: escape planning, abandon ship procedures, survival after abandonment]*

## Security Protocols by Threat Level

### Level 1 (Monitoring): Standard Precautions
- Research security situation in cruising area
- Maintain awareness
- Standard deterrents (watch, lights, locked boat)

### Level 2 (Enhanced Readiness): Heightened Security
- Avoid high-risk anchorages
- Enhanced watch (24/7 if in questionable area)
- Weapons accessible (if carried)
- Communication devices ready
- Plan for rapid departure

### Level 3 (Activation): Active Threat Avoidance
- Depart high-risk area immediately
- Avoid contact with unknown vessels
- Night watch with weapons ready (if carried)
- Minimal time at anchor (keep moving)
- Full communication blackout (AIS off, no VHF)

### Level 4 (Survival): Extreme Security
- Treat all unknowns as potential threats
- Defensive measures continuously active
- Weapons ready at all times (if carried)
- Anchor only in remote, hidden locations
- Zero contact with others unless clearly safe

---

## Family Security Training

### Drills and Scenarios
- "Suspicious approach" drill (what to do when unknown vessel approaches)
- Nighttime intruder drill
- Rapid departure drill
- Weapon handling (if applicable, adults only)

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Lookout**: Detect threats early
- **Communication**: Radio for help, document situation
- **Defense**: Primary defender (trained adult)
- **Children**: Safety first (hide in designated safe space, follow adult directions)

### Children's Safety
- Age-appropriate security briefings (avoid causing fear, provide empowerment)
- Safe hiding spots aboard (rehearsed)
- Emergency signals (code words for danger)
- Obedience to parent commands (instant, without question during emergency)
