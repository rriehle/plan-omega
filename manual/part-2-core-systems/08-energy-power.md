## Introduction

Electrical power supports navigation, communication, water production, refrigeration, lighting, and many other critical systems. This chapter addresses power generation, storage, management, and conservation using P.A.C.E. redundancy.

## Power Requirements Analysis

### Calculate Your Needs
- List all electrical devices
- Determine wattage or amperage
- Estimate daily usage hours
- Calculate daily consumption (amp-hours or watt-hours)

### Typical Power Consumers (example):
- Watermaker: 10A × 2 hrs = 20 Ah
- Refrigeration: 5A × 12 hrs = 60 Ah (cycling)
- Navigation lights: 2A × 10 hrs = 20 Ah
- Electronics (chartplotter, VHF, etc.): ~10 Ah
- Lighting: ~5 Ah
- **Total example**: ~115 Ah/day

## P.A.C.E. Power Plan

### PRIMARY: Solar Panels + Battery Bank

**Description:** Renewable, quiet, low-maintenance power generation

**Solar system components:**
- Solar panels (400-800W typical for cruising sailboat)
- MPPT charge controller (Maximum Power Point Tracking)
- Battery bank (400-800 Ah typical)
- Monitoring system (track production and consumption)

**Battery types:**
- Lead-acid (FLA or AGM): Cheaper, proven, heavier
- Lithium (LiFePO4): Lighter, higher efficiency, more expensive, better depth of discharge

**System sizing:**
- Solar must produce daily consumption × 1.5-2 (accounting for losses, cloudy days)
- Battery bank: 3-5 days autonomy

**Maintenance:**
- Clean panels regularly
- Check battery terminals and connections
- Monitor battery health
- Log production and consumption

*[To be expanded: sizing calculations, installation considerations, battery management]*

---

### ALTERNATE: Wind Generator + Backup Batteries

**Description:** Complements solar (works at night, cloudy, windy conditions)

**Wind generator:**
- 200-600W typical for cruising boat
- Noisy, mechanical wear
- Good in windy anchorages or at sea
- Independent charge controller

**Implementation:**
- Mount securely (pole or arch)
- Wiring separate from solar (or combined with diode isolation)
- Shutdown capability (storms, excess power)

**Combined solar + wind:**
- Diversified production
- More consistent power (sun + wind unlikely both absent)
- Increased reliability

*[To be expanded: wind generator selection, installation, combination systems]*

---

### CONTINGENCY: Fuel Generator + Stored Fuel

**Description:** On-demand power from fuel

**Generators:**
- Portable or fixed installation
- Gasoline or diesel
- 1-3 kW typical
- Noisy, consumes fuel

**Fuel considerations:**
- Storage (100-200 liters minimum for extended autonomy)
- Stabilizer (fuel degrades over time)
- Safety (ventilation, fire risk)
- Finite resource (use sparingly)

**Use cases:**
- Cloudy periods when solar/wind insufficient
- High-demand situations (running watermaker, powering tools)
- Battery charging when renewables fail

*[To be expanded: generator selection, fuel storage, operation]*

---

### EMERGENCY: Manual Power + Extreme Conservation

**Description:** Hand-crank and minimal power consumption

**Manual/battery backup devices:**
- Hand-crank flashlights and radios
- Battery-powered LED lights (pre-charged)
- Manual bilge pumps (no power needed)
- Wind-up or solar-charged small electronics

**Extreme conservation:**
- Turn off all non-essential systems
- Navigation by compass and paper charts (no electronics)
- No refrigeration (eat perishables first, then preserved foods)
- Minimal lighting (use daylight hours)
- Communication only when critical

**Priority power allocation:**
- Navigation safety (lights at night)
- Emergency communication (VHF, EPIRB)
- Bilge pumps (if needed)
- Essential lights (cabin, cockpit)

*[To be expanded: hand-crank devices, conservation strategies, emergency power protocols]*

---

## Power Management and Conservation

### Daily Monitoring
- Track production (solar/wind/generator)
- Track consumption
- Monitor battery state of charge
- Adjust usage based on weather forecast

### Conservation Techniques
- LED lighting (low power)
- Efficient appliances (modern electronics, good insulation on refrigeration)
- Turn off when not in use
- Consolidate tasks (run watermaker once daily vs. continuously)
- Use sunlight (passive lighting, heating, drying)

### Load Shedding Priority
**If power scarce, shut down in this order:**
1. Comfort items (fans, entertainment)
2. Refrigeration (switch to cooler with ice or no cooling)
3. High-consumption devices (watermaker—use stored water)
4. Navigation electronics (switch to paper charts)
5. Last to go: Safety lights, bilge pumps, emergency comms
