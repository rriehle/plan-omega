## Introduction

Water is the most critical survival resource. The human body can survive only 3 days without water, and performance degrades significantly within hours of dehydration. At sea, you are paradoxically surrounded by water you cannot drink. This chapter details comprehensive water systems using P.A.C.E. methodology to ensure you always have access to safe drinking water.

## Water Requirements

### Daily Needs per Person

**Drinking only (survival):** 2 liters (0.5 gallons)
**Drinking + cooking:** 4 liters (1 gallon)
**Drinking + cooking + hygiene:** 6-8 liters (1.5-2 gallons)
**Comfortable living:** 10-15 liters (2.5-4 gallons)

**For family of four:**
- Survival minimum: 8 L/day (2 gallons/day)
- Basic comfort: 30 L/day (8 gallons/day)
- Full comfort: 40-60 L/day (10-15 gallons/day)

### Storage Targets

**Minimum:** 30 days at survival rate
- Family of 4: 240 L (60 gallons)

**Recommended:** 60 days at basic comfort rate
- Family of 4: 1,800 L (475 gallons)

**Ideal:** 90 days at basic comfort + ability to produce water
- Family of 4: 2,700 L (715 gallons) + watermaker/catchment

### PRIMARY: Watermaker (Reverse Osmosis Desalinator)

**Description:**
Electric or engine-driven reverse osmosis system that converts seawater to potable water.

**Advantages:**
- Unlimited source (seawater)
- High production rate (20-60+ liters/hour typical)
- Low effort (automated)
- Reliable when maintained
- Relatively efficient energy use

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires power (significant draw: 5-20A for DC systems, more for AC)
- Mechanical complexity (pumps, membranes, controls)
- Requires maintenance and spare parts
- Vulnerable to fouling, contamination
- Fails if electrical system fails
- Requires clean seawater (not in harbors or polluted areas)

#### Implementation:

**System selection:**
- Sized for family needs: 20+ gallons/hour minimum
- DC system (12V/24V) preferred over AC (more versatile power sources)
- Quality brands: Spectra, Katadyn, Sea Recovery, Village Marine
- Consider manual backup capability (some Spectra models)

**Installation requirements:**
- Through-hull intake (with strainer)
- Seawater pump (high pressure, 800+ PSI)
- Pre-filters (sediment, carbon)
- RO membrane
- Control system
- Product water and brine discharge
- Power supply (dedicated circuit)

**Maintenance schedule:**
- **Before each use**: Check intake strainer, run freshwater flush
- **After each use**: Freshwater flush (critical for membrane preservation)
- **Weekly** (if in regular use): Inspect connections, check pressures
- **Monthly**: Replace pre-filters, pickle membrane if not in use
- **Annually**: Full system service, membrane assessment, replace consumables

**Spare parts to carry:**
- Pre-filters (10+ sets)
- Membrane (1-2 spares—expensive but critical)
- Seawater pump rebuild kit
- O-rings and gaskets
- Pressure switch/sensors
- Tubing and fittings

**Failure modes:**
- Membrane fouling (biological, chemical, particulate)
- Pump failure (mechanical or electrical)
- Electrical failure (controller, power supply)
- Clogged filters
- Through-hull blockage
- Contaminated product water (membrane breach)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Low production → Check filters, membrane condition, pressure
- High pressure → Clogged filters or membrane fouling
- Salty product water → Membrane failure, replace immediately
- No power → Electrical system failure, revert to Alternate system

**Skills required:**
- Basic maintenance (filter changes, pickling)
- Troubleshooting (pressure testing, flow rate checks)
- Membrane replacement
- System operation and monitoring

**Cost:** $2,500 - $8,000+ (system + installation + spares)

### ALTERNATE: Rain Catchment and Storage

**Description:**
Collecting rainwater from sails, Bimini, deck, or dedicated catchment surfaces; filtering and storing for use.

**Advantages:**
- Free, renewable resource
- No power required (passive collection)
- High-quality water (low mineral content)
- Large volumes possible in rainy climates
- Low technology, low maintenance
- Multiple methods available

**Disadvantages:**
- Weather-dependent (unreliable in dry climates/seasons)
- Requires rain events
- Initial catchment contaminated (bird droppings, salt spray, dust)
- Storage required
- Contamination risk if not filtered

#### Implementation:

**Catchment methods:**

1. **Sail catchment** (highest yield)
   - Boom down, main sail forms a trough
   - Attach hose to grommet or low point
   - First 5-10 gallons discarded (wash sail)
   - Then collect into jerry cans or tanks
   - Can collect 100+ gallons in good rain

2. **Bimini/dodger catchment**
   - Direct runoff to hose
   - Always ready (no setup)
   - Lower volume than sails
   - 5-20 gallons per rain event

3. **Deck catchment**
   - Scuppers directed to collection
   - First runoff discarded (dirty deck)
   - Good for large volumes
   - Requires clean deck (no teak, fuel spills, etc.)

4. **Dedicated catchment tarp**
   - Deploy in rain (stretched between hard points)
   - Very high yield
   - Requires setup
   - Good for extended rain

**Filtration:**
- **Minimum**: First flush discarded, then basic sediment filter
- **Better**: Sediment filter + carbon filter (taste, odor)
- **Best**: Sediment + carbon + UV or chemical treatment (bacteria/virus)

**Storage:**
- Existing water tanks (if clean)
- Jerry cans/containers (food-grade plastic)
- Bladders (flexible water storage)
- Ensure containers clean before use

**Calculation:**
- 1mm rainfall on 1 m² = 1 liter
- Example: 10mm rain (moderate shower) on 20 m² sail = 200 liters
- Tropical rain: 20-50mm common → 400-1000 liters possible per event

**Maintenance:**
- Keep sails/bimini clean
- Inspect and clean catchment surfaces before rain
- Sanitize collection containers regularly
- Check filters and replace as needed

**Failure modes:**
- No rain (drought, dry season, wrong location)
- Contaminated catchment surface
- Insufficient storage
- Broken collection system

**Skills required:**
- Setting up catchment system
- Water quality assessment
- Filtration techniques
- Storage management

**Cost:** $100-$500 (tarps, hoses, containers, filters)

### CONTINGENCY: Solar Still and Manual Desalinator

**Description:**
Low-volume, manual methods for producing drinking water from seawater when Primary and Alternate fail.

**Advantages:**
- No power required (solar) or low power (manual)
- Portable and backup systems
- Proven technology
- Can work in any ocean condition

**Disadvantages:**
- Low production rate (slow)
- Labor-intensive (manual)
- Weather-dependent (solar still needs sun)
- Requires physical effort (manual pump)
- Low efficiency

#### Method 1: Solar Still

**Types:**

1. **Commercial solar still** (e.g., Aquamate, SolarSurvivalStill)
   - Inflatable or rigid
   - Passive (no pumping)
   - Production: 1-3 liters/day in good sun
   - Cost: $200-$500

2. **DIY solar still**
   - Large plastic sheet or clear container
   - Black water base
   - Condensation collection
   - Production: 0.5-2 liters/day
   - Cost: $20-$50 (materials)

**Implementation:**
- Deploy in full sun
- Fill with seawater
- Sun heats water → evaporation → condensation → collection
- Maintain and clean regularly
- Slow but steady production

**Limitations:**
- Requires sunny weather (not in storms or overcast)
- Low volume (insufficient for full family needs)
- Takes up deck space

#### Method 2: Manual Reverse Osmosis Desalinator

**Examples:**
- Katadyn Survivor 06/35
- Aquamate Aqua Bucket
- HRO Manual Desalinator

**Production:** 4-6 liters/hour (with continuous pumping)

**Operation:**
- Manual pump (hand or foot)
- High pressure required (continuous effort)
- Produces drinkable water from seawater
- Physically exhausting

**Advantages over solar still:**
- Works in any weather
- Higher production rate
- Compact

**Implementation:**
- Practice using before needed (build endurance)
- Rotate family members (share effort)
- Combine with rationing to extend value

**Cost:** $800-$1,500

### EMERGENCY: Stored Emergency Water + Extreme Conservation

**Description:**
When all production methods fail, rely on pre-positioned emergency rations and strict conservation.

**Components:**

1. **Emergency water rations**
   - Commercially packaged, long shelf life (5 years)
   - Datrex, SOS, Mayday brands
   - Individual pouches (125ml typical)
   - Store in liferaft, abandon-ship bag, multiple locations

**Quantity:**
- Minimum: 7 days for family (56 liters / 15 gallons)
- Better: 14 days (112 liters / 30 gallons)
- Best: 30 days (240 liters / 60 gallons)

2. **Extreme rationing protocol**
   - Reduce to absolute minimum: 0.5 L/person/day
   - Prioritize children, then adults
   - No cooking (requires water)
   - Minimal hygiene
   - Reduce physical activity (conserve water through reduced sweating)

3. **Moisture recovery**
   - Dew collection (tarp at night)
   - Condensation from surfaces
   - Body moisture conservation (breathe through cloth, reduce talking)

4. **Seawater use (non-drinking)**
   - Cooling (wet clothing)
   - Initial wash (then rinse with fresh)
   - Never drink seawater (accelerates dehydration/kidney failure)

**Emergency protocols:**

**If water production fails:**
1. Immediately begin strict rationing
2. Deploy emergency water rations (use oldest first)
3. Attempt all contingency methods (solar still, manual desalinator)
4. Reduce activity to minimize water needs
5. Navigate to landfall or rain area
6. Send distress signal if life-threatening

**Calculation:**
- Emergency rations: 30 days × 0.5 L/person/day × 4 people = 60 L
- Store 60+ liters in emergency form
- Review and rotate every 2 years

**Cost:** $200-$400 (emergency rations)

## Water Quality and Treatment

### Potential Contaminants

**Rainwater:**
- Biological: Bird droppings, airborne bacteria
- Chemical: Salt spray, pollutants
- Physical: Dust, debris

**Seawater (produced via watermaker):**
- Usually clean if system works correctly
- Test regularly to ensure membrane integrity

**Shore water (if procured):**
- Highly variable quality
- Assume contaminated unless confirmed safe

**Stored water:**
- Biological growth over time (bacteria, algae)
- Tank contamination

### Treatment Methods

**Filtration:**
- **Sediment filter**: Removes particulates (dirt, rust, debris)
- **Carbon filter**: Removes chemicals, improves taste/odor
- **Ceramic filter**: Removes bacteria and protozoa (not viruses)

**Disinfection:**
- **Boiling**: 1 minute at rolling boil (+ 1 minute per 1000m elevation), kills all pathogens
- **Chemical**: Bleach (8 drops/gallon, wait 30 min), iodine tablets, chlorine dioxide
- **UV**: UV sterilizer (SteriPEN, etc.), effective against all pathogens, requires clear water

**Testing:**
- Test kits for bacteria, salinity
- TDS meter (total dissolved solids—watermaker output should be <500 ppm, ideally <200 ppm)

**Storage sanitation:**
- Shock treatment (heavy chlorination) when filling tanks
- Regular tank inspection and cleaning (annually)
- Never mix old and new water without treatment

---

## Water Storage Design

### Tank Types

**Integral tanks** (built into hull)
- Largest capacity
- Fixed location
- Requires careful cleaning
- Typically stainless steel, aluminum, or plastic

**Flexible bladders**
- Use odd spaces (under berths, etc.)
- Easy to add capacity
- Can be removed for cleaning
- Vetus, Nauta, Plastimo brands

**Jerry cans / rigid containers**
- Portable
- Easy to clean/replace
- Versatile
- 5-20 liter sizes typical
- Can be positioned for trim

**Combination approach (best):**
- Integral tanks: Primary storage (50-70% of capacity)
- Bladders: Additional storage (20-30%)
- Jerry cans: Emergency reserves, flexibility (10-20%)

### Tank Management

**Separate systems:**
- Drinking water (highest quality)
- Washing water (lower quality acceptable)
- Saltwater (deck wash, initial cleaning)

**Rotation:**
- Use oldest water first
- Refill regularly (don't let tanks go stale)
- Date jerry cans

**Monitoring:**
- Tank level gauges (critical to know supply)
- Redundant measurement (dipsticks, sight tubes)
- Daily log of consumption and production

---

## Calculations and Planning

### Example: 60-Day Autonomy Plan

**Family of 4:**
- Consumption: 30 L/day (basic comfort)
- 60 days × 30 L = 1,800 L total

**Strategy:**
- **Storage**: 900 L (30 days in tanks/containers)
- **Production**: Watermaker (30 L/day average)
- **Backup**: Rain catchment (supplement during rainy periods)
- **Emergency**: 60 L emergency rations

**Daily routine:**
- Produce: 30 L via watermaker (or rainwater if available)
- Consume: 30 L
- Storage maintained at 900 L (reserve)

**If watermaker fails:**
- Switch to rain catchment + rationing
- 900 L reserve ÷ 15 L/day (rationed) = 60 days to find solution
- Deploy contingency methods (solar still, manual desalinator)

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily:
- Check water levels
- Log consumption
- Produce water as needed
- Inspect active system (watermaker or catchment)

### Weekly:
- Test water quality (taste, visual)
- Inspect tanks and containers
- Check for leaks
- Clean filters if in use

### Monthly:
- Sanitize one tank (rotating schedule)
- Replace watermaker pre-filters
- Check spare parts inventory
- Review consumption patterns

### Quarterly:
- Full system audit
- Test alternate and contingency systems
- Drill: operate for 48 hours on Alternate system only
- Update plans based on learnings

---

## Special Considerations

### Hot Climates

- Increased consumption (sweating)
- Add 20-30% to requirements
- Heat exhaustion risk if under-hydrated
- More critical to maintain supply

### Children

- Lower consumption per child but higher vulnerability to dehydration
- Ensure priority access to water in rationing
- Monitor hydration closely (urine color, skin turgor, behavior)

### Medical Needs

- Illness increases water needs (fever, vomiting, diarrhea)
- Water required for medical hygiene
- Medication may require water
- Account for medical surge in planning
