## Introduction

Your boat is the platform for all other survival systems. If the vessel fails, everything else fails. This chapter addresses boat maintenance, heavy weather preparation, damage control, and repair capabilities for long-term autonomy without shipyard access.

## P.A.C.E. Shelter Plan

### PRIMARY: Proactive Maintenance and Prevention

**Description:** Prevent failures through rigorous maintenance

**Critical systems:**
- Hull integrity (blisters, cracks, through-hulls)
- Rigging (standing and running)
- Sails (condition, repairs)
- Engine (oil, filters, impeller, cooling, fuel)
- Electrical (batteries, wiring, corrosion)
- Plumbing (seacocks, hoses, pumps)
- Deck hardware (winches, cleats, chainplates)
- Rudder and steering

**Maintenance schedule:**
- **Daily**: Visual inspection, bilge check
- **Weekly**: Systems check, running engine, charging batteries
- **Monthly**: Detailed inspection, specific maintenance tasks
- **Quarterly**: Haul out (if possible), bottom paint, anode replacement
- **Annually**: Full survey, replace age-limited items, major service

**Documentation:**
- Maintenance log (all work documented)
- Systems manual (how everything works)
- Troubleshooting guides
- Spare parts inventory

*[To be expanded: detailed maintenance schedules by system, inspection checklists]*

### ALTERNATE: Field Repairs and Jury Rigging

**Description:** Fix problems using onboard resources and skills

**Essential skills:**
- Fiberglass repair
- Metal fabrication/welding
- Woodworking
- Rigging work (splicing, serving, swaging)
- Sail repair
- Engine repair (diesel mechanics)
- Electrical troubleshooting
- Plumbing

**Critical spare parts:**
- Through-hull plugs (multiple sizes)
- Hoses and clamps
- Seacocks
- Impellers (engine, water pump)
- Belts and filters (engine)
- Electrical wire, connectors, fuses
- Epoxy and fiberglass cloth
- Rigging wire, turnbuckles, shackles
- Sail repair materials
- Fasteners (bolts, screws, rivets)

**Tools:**
- Hand tools (comprehensive set)
- Power tools (drill, angle grinder, etc.)
- Rigging tools (swage tool, wire cutters)
- Sail repair kit
- Welding capability (if possible)
- Multimeter and electrical tools

*[To be expanded: comprehensive spare parts lists, repair techniques, tool requirements]*

---

### CONTINGENCY: Improvised Repairs and Survival Jury Rigs

**Description:** Keep boat afloat using improvisation when proper parts unavailable

**Scenarios and solutions:**
- **Rudder loss**: Emergency rudder (spinnaker pole, boards, drogue steering)
- **Mast loss**: Jury rig (salvage mast, improvised stays, storm sails)
- **Hull breach**: Collision mat, epoxy patches, underwater epoxy, wooden plugs
- **Engine failure**: Sail-only operations, drift anchors
- **Steering failure**: Emergency tiller, wheel-to-rudder linkage, wind vane

**Improvisation materials:**
- Wood (teak, plywood, spars)
- Rope and cordage
- Tarps and canvas
- Metal stock (if carried)
- Epoxy and adhesives
- Fasteners

*[To be expanded: jury rig techniques, improvisation case studies, emergency procedures]*

---

### EMERGENCY: Damage Control and Abandon Ship

**Description:** Life-saving measures when vessel compromised

**Damage control:**
- Collision/grounding response
- Fire suppression
- Flooding control (pumps, plugs, patches)
- Stabilization and temporary repairs
- Distress signaling

**Abandon ship:**
- When to abandon (vessel sinking, fire out of control, immediate danger)
- Liferaft deployment and boarding
- Abandon ship bag (grab bag essentials)
- EPIRB activation
- Survival at sea

**Liferaft and abandon ship equipment:**
- Liferaft (serviced regularly, adequate capacity)
- EPIRB (406 MHz, registered)
- Handheld VHF (waterproof)
- Flares and signals
- Abandon ship bag (water, food, first aid, etc.)
- Immersion suits or PFDs

*[To be expanded: damage control procedures, abandon ship protocols, liferaft survival]*

---

## Heavy Weather Preparation

### Storm-Ready Boat Configuration
- Storm sails rigged and ready
- Jacklines rigged
- All gear secured
- Hatches and ports dogged
- Bilge pumps operational
- Emergency equipment accessible
- EPIRB and communication devices ready

### Heavy Weather Tactics
- Heaving to
- Running off
- Deploying drogues or sea anchors
- Storm management strategies
- Crew safety (harnesses, tethers, PFDs)

*[To be expanded: specific heavy weather tactics, equipment, training]*

---

## Anchoring and Mooring

### Anchor Systems
- Primary anchor (sized for vessel and conditions)
- Secondary anchor (different type for redundancy)
- Storm anchor (oversized for extreme conditions)
- Rode (chain and rope, adequate scope)

### Anchoring Techniques
- Scope calculations (5:1 minimum, 7:1 for storms)
- Bottom types and anchor selection
- Multiple anchor deployment
- Anchor watch protocols

*[To be expanded: anchoring techniques, calculations, equipment]*
