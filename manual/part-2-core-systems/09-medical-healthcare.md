*[To be expanded: complete medical kit lists by category, medication dosing guides]*

---

### ALTERNATE: Advanced First Aid + Medical References

**Description:** When communication fails, rely on training and books

**Enhanced training:**
- Practice medical procedures (suturing on pig skin, splinting, etc.)
- Scenario-based learning (simulate injuries)
- Cross-training (multiple family members)

**Expanded references:**
- Digital library (PDFs on tablet/computer)
- Physical books (backup when electronics fail)
- Field manuals (military medical, wilderness medicine)

**Diagnostic skills:**
- Physical exam techniques
- Symptom interpretation
- Differential diagnosis (determine likely cause)

*[To be expanded: self-study programs, practice scenarios, diagnostic flowcharts]*

---

### CONTINGENCY: Field Expedient Medicine + Natural Remedies

**Description:** Improvised treatments when supplies are depleted

**Improvised supplies:**
- Wound closure: Superglue (cyanoacrylate), fishing line sutures
- Bandages: Clean cloth, torn clothing
- Splints: Wood, padded with cloth
- IV fluids: Coconut water (electrolyte substitute)
- Antiseptics: Saltwater, honey, alcohol (drinking)

**Natural/traditional remedies:**
- Willow bark (salicylic acid / aspirin-like)
- Honey (wound dressing, antibacterial)
- Garlic (antibiotic properties)
- Ginger (anti-nausea)
- Aloe vera (burns, skin conditions)
- Tea tree oil (antiseptic)
- Clove oil (dental pain)

**Knowledge requirements:**
- Medicinal plants by region
- Preparation and dosing
- Limitations and risks (not substitutes for modern medicine when available)

*[To be expanded: regional medicinal plant guides, preparation methods, field expedient techniques]*

---

### EMERGENCY: Basic Trauma Care + Pain Management

**Description:** Life-saving interventions when nothing else available

**ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation):**
- Airway clearance (choking, unconscious)
- Rescue breathing / CPR
- Hemorrhage control (pressure, tourniquets)

**Shock management:**
- Position (elevate legs if trauma, head if stroke)
- Warmth
- Fluids (if conscious and no abdominal trauma)

**Pain management without medication:**
- Positioning
- Immobilization
- Ice/cold (reduce swelling)
- Distraction techniques
- Splinting

**Stabilization for evacuation:**
- When to call for help (EPIRB, radio)
- Stabilizing patient for transport
- Communicating with rescue

*[To be expanded: trauma protocols, stabilization techniques, evacuation decision-making]*

---

## Specific Medical Scenarios

### Chronic Conditions
- **Diabetes**: Insulin storage (refrigeration, expiration), blood glucose monitoring, diet management
- **Hypertension**: Medication stockpile, BP monitoring, salt restriction
- **Asthma**: Inhalers (adequate supply), trigger avoidance
- **Mental health**: Psychiatric medications (adequate supply), coping strategies, crisis intervention

*[To be expanded: condition-specific management plans]*

### Dental Emergencies
- **Toothache**: Pain management, infection control, temporary filling
- **Lost filling/crown**: Temporary dental cement

- **Abscess**: Antibiotics, drainage (if trained), pain management

**Dental kit:**
- Temporary filling material
- Dental cement
- Clove oil (pain relief)
- Dental mirror and explorer
- Extraction tools (last resort, extreme training needed)

### Pregnancy and Childbirth

- **Drowning/near-drowning**: Rescue breathing, CPR, monitor for secondary drowning

---

## Disease Prevention

### Hygiene and Sanitation
- Handwashing (most important!)
- Food safety (cooking temperatures, storage)
- Water purification
- Waste management (human waste, trash)
- Vector control (mosquitoes, flies, rats)

### Vaccinations
- Routine immunizations up to date before departure
- Travel vaccines (yellow fever, typhoid, hepatitis A/B, etc.) for destination regions
- Boosters and updates as needed

### Disease Screening
- Self-monitoring for symptoms
- Early intervention (fever, rash, GI symptoms)
- Isolation if contagious

---

## Medication Storage and Management

### Storage Conditions
- Cool, dry, dark location
- Waterproof containers
- Organized by type and expiration
- Rotation (use oldest first)

### Expiration and Degradation
- Most medications safe past expiration (reduced potency)
- Critical medications: Replace before expiration
- Antibiotics, EpiPens: Don't use significantly expired
- Storage extends life (cool, dark, dry)

### Prescription Acquisition
- Work with physician to prescribe extended supplies
- Consider fish antibiotics (same as human, less regulated) as backup
- International procurement (some countries less restrictive)
