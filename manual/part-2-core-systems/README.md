# Part II: Core Survival Systems

## Overview

This section details the essential systems required for long-term survival aboard a sailboat. Each chapter provides comprehensive coverage of one critical system using the P.A.C.E. framework (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) to ensure redundancy at every level.

## The Six Critical Systems

1. **Water** - Procurement, storage, purification
2. **Food** - Storage, fishing, preservation, foraging
3. **Shelter** - Vessel integrity, maintenance, heavy weather
4. **Energy** - Power generation, storage, conservation
5. **Medical** - Healthcare, first aid, disease prevention
6. **Security** - Threat avoidance, defense, evasion

## Why These Systems?

These six systems represent the fundamental requirements for survival:

- **Water**: Death in 3 days without it
- **Food**: Death in 3 weeks without it; malnutrition degrades all other capabilities
- **Shelter**: The boat is your survival platform; lose it and everything else fails
- **Energy**: Powers critical systems (navigation, communication, water, light)
- **Medical**: Injury or illness can be fatal without care; prevents small problems from becoming catastrophic
- **Security**: Threats from other humans can end everything instantly

## P.A.C.E. Integration Across Systems

Many systems depend on each other. Understanding these dependencies is critical:

```
POWER → Medical (sterilization), Water (desalination), Food (refrigeration), Navigation, Communication
WATER → Medical (hygiene), Food (cooking, cleaning), Health
SHELTER → Everything (boat is the platform for all systems)
MEDICAL → Capability to maintain all other systems
SECURITY → Ability to keep all resources and family safe
```

## System Development Priority

If you cannot develop all systems simultaneously, prioritize in this order:

### Phase 1: Immediate Survival (Can't live without)
1. **Water** - Most urgent need
2. **Shelter** - Vessel must be seaworthy
3. **Medical** - Injuries/illness can't wait

### Phase 2: Short-term Sustainability (First months)
4. **Food** - Stockpiles and procurement
5. **Energy** - Powers other systems
6. **Security** - Threat awareness and basic defense

### Phase 3: Long-term Resilience (Extended autonomy)
- Advanced capabilities in all six systems
- Full P.A.C.E. redundancy implemented
- Regular testing and maintenance protocols

## Using These Chapters

### For Each System:

1. **Read the full chapter** to understand the complete P.A.C.E. plan

2. **Assess current capability** using the checklist at the end of each chapter

3. **Identify gaps** between current state and full P.A.C.E. implementation

4. **Prioritize improvements** based on:
   - Likelihood of failure
   - Severity of failure
   - Cost to implement
   - Time to implement

5. **Create action plan** with specific steps, timeline, and budget

6. **Test each level** through drills (monthly/quarterly as specified)

7. **Document and update** based on testing results and changing circumstances

### Integration Across Chapters:

Don't develop systems in isolation:

- **Cross-training**: All adults should understand all systems
- **Dependency mapping**: Know which systems support which others
- **Cascade failure planning**: What happens if multiple systems fail simultaneously?
- **Resource sharing**: Some resources (power, space, funds) support multiple systems—allocate wisely

## System Status Tracking

Track the development status of each system:

| System | Primary | Alternate | Contingency | Emergency | Overall Status |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Water | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Complete |
| Food | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Complete |
| Shelter | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Complete |
| Energy | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Complete |
| Medical | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Complete |
| Security | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Ready | ☐ Complete |

**Goal**: All systems at "Complete" (full P.A.C.E. implementation) before threat level reaches Level 3.

## Maintenance and Testing Schedule

**Monthly:**
- Test one alternate or contingency method for one system
- Rotate through systems (6 systems = all tested every 6 months)
- Document results and identify improvements

**Quarterly:**
- Full system audit: inventory, condition check, expirations
- Update provisions and supplies
- Review and update P.A.C.E. plans based on experience

**Annually:**
- Major drill: Multi-system failure scenario
- Complete inventory and refresh
- Skills training/refresher for all family members
- Update plans based on changing threat landscape

## Resource Allocation

Typical resource distribution for full P.A.C.E. implementation:

**Financial:**
- Water: 10-15% (watermaker, storage, filtration)
- Food: 20-25% (long-term provisions, fishing gear, preservation)
- Shelter: 25-30% (maintenance, spares, safety gear)
- Energy: 15-20% (solar, wind, batteries, backup)
- Medical: 10-15% (supplies, training, reference materials)
- Security: 5-10% (varies greatly based on approach)

**Space (storage):**
- Water: 20% (largest single requirement)
- Food: 35% (bulk provisions)
- Spare parts/tools: 20%
- Medical: 5%
- Other: 20%

**Time/Training:**
- Seamanship/vessel: 30%
- Medical: 20%
- Fishing/food: 15%
- Navigation: 15%
- Security: 10%
- Other skills: 10%
