# Part I: Foundation & Strategy

## Overview

Before developing specific survival skills and systems, you must establish the mental, strategic, and analytical foundation for long-term survival. This section addresses the psychological preparation, threat analysis, strategic planning frameworks, and destination research that will guide all subsequent decisions.

## Why Foundation Matters

History shows that physical resources alone don't ensure survival—mental preparation and strategic thinking are paramount. The psychology of survival often determines outcomes more than equipment or supplies. A family with strong mental resilience, clear plans, and good decision-making processes will outperform a better-equipped family in chaos and panic.

## Integration with Other Parts

**Part I → Part II**: Strategic planning informs which survival systems need the most redundancy.

**Part I → Part III**: Destination analysis determines which skills and knowledge are most critical.

**Part I → Part IV**: Threat assessment directly feeds into scenario-specific responses.

**Part I → Part V**: The trigger framework from Part I becomes the action matrix in Part V.

## Development Priorities

When building out Part I, prioritize:

1. **Threat Assessment** - Establish your monitoring and warning systems first
2. **Destinations** - Know where you might need to go before crisis hits
3. **Strategic Planning** - Apply P.A.C.E. to your most critical systems
4. **Psychology** - Build mental resilience through ongoing practice

## Action Items for Part I

- [ ] Complete family discussion about collapse scenarios and psychological readiness
- [ ] Identify 3-5 trusted information sources for each threat type
- [ ] Research and evaluate 10+ potential safe harbor destinations
- [ ] Create initial P.A.C.E. plans for top 3 critical systems (water, food, security)
- [ ] Establish baseline threat indicators for each scenario
- [ ] Develop family communication protocols for stress and crisis
