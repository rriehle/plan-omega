## Introduction

Your boat's greatest advantage is mobility—the ability to relocate to safety when conditions deteriorate. But this advantage is only useful if you know *where* to go, *when* to leave, and *how* to get there. This chapter provides frameworks for evaluating potential destinations, strategic positioning, and route planning for each collapse scenario.

## Destination Selection Criteria

### Universal Criteria (All Scenarios)

Regardless of which collapse scenario unfolds, evaluate destinations on these factors:

#### 1. **Resource Availability**

**Water:**
- Freshwater sources (streams, wells, rainfall)
- Reliability across seasons

**Community:**
- Existing cruiser community (network and knowledge)
- Potential to integrate if needed
- Hostility vs. hospitality

#### 6. **Political Stability**

**National:**
- Government legitimacy
- Economic stability
- Recent coups or unrest

**Regional:**

## Scenario-Specific Destination Strategies

Different scenarios require different safe harbors. Identify destinations for each scenario—some overlap is good.

---

### Economic Collapse Destinations

**What you need:**
- Regions less affected by global economic interdependence
- Local economies and trade opportunities
- Places where skills/labor have value
- Stable local currency or barter systems

#### Top Destination Types:

**1. Remote islands with local subsistence economies**
- Not dependent on imports
- Food and water available locally
- Example regions: South Pacific (Marquesas, Vanuatu outer islands), remote Caribbean

**Pros:** Self-sufficient, already adapted to isolation, welcoming to contributors
**Cons:** Limited medical care, basic infrastructure, cyclone risk in some areas

**2. Stable, neutral nations with local economies**
- Countries with low debt, diverse economies
- Strong regional trade
- Example regions: Parts of New Zealand, Chile, Uruguay, some Nordic countries

**Pros:** Infrastructure, rule of law, economic resilience
**Cons:** Expensive, immigration restrictions, may have their own problems

**3. Coastal areas with strong fishing and agriculture**
- Can provide food through labor
- Less dependent on currency
- Example regions: Pacific Mexico, Central America, Southeast Asia (carefully selected)

**Pros:** Abundant food, established expat communities, relatively welcoming
**Cons:** Political instability in some areas, crime, disease

#### Evaluation Questions:
- How import-dependent is this region for food and essentials?
- Can we trade skills or labor for necessities?
- Is there a functioning local economy when global trade collapses?
- What's the banking/currency situation?

---

### Civil Unrest Destinations

**What you need:**
- Remote locations far from population centers
- Low or no enforcement of immigration
- Cultures with no history of political violence
- Easy departure if unrest spreads

#### Top Destination Types:

**1. Extremely remote anchorages (uninhabited or nearly so)**
- Far from any conflict
- Self-sufficient mandatory
- Example regions: Patagonia channels, remote Pacific atolls, Arctic Norway, Aleutians

**Pros:** No people = no civil unrest, complete autonomy
**Cons:** Harsh conditions, isolation, difficult resupply, rescue impossible

**2. Politically neutral nations with social cohesion**
- Strong social fabric, low inequality
- History of neutrality and avoiding conflict
- Example regions: Switzerland (expensive), Iceland, Greenland, parts of Scandinavia

**Pros:** Unlikely to experience internal violence, rule of law maintained
**Cons:** Immigration barriers, expensive, limited anchoring options

**3. Small island nations with peaceful cultures**
- No history of civil conflict
- Small population, homogeneous culture
- Example regions: Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, some Micronesian nations

**Pros:** Peaceful, cruiser-friendly, subsistence possible
**Cons:** Cyclone risk, vulnerable to outside conflicts, limited resources

#### Evaluation Questions:
- How far from cities and potential unrest?
- What's the history of political violence in this culture?
- Can we leave quickly if situation deteriorates?
- Is local population armed/dangerous or peaceful?
- Any ethnic, religious, or political tensions?

---

### Climate Collapse Destinations

**What you need:**
- Regions projected to remain habitable (temperature, water)
- Stable weather patterns (as much as possible)
- Resilient ecosystems
- High latitude options as tropics become uninhabitable

#### Top Destination Types:

**1. High-latitude regions (40°-60° latitude)**
- Cooler as planet warms
- More rainfall in some areas
- Example regions: Patagonia, New Zealand, Tasmania, British Columbia, Norway, Scotland

**Pros:** Habitable temperatures longer, lower disease risk, fresh water
**Cons:** Cold, storms, short growing seasons, may attract climate refugees

**2. Islands with reliable rainfall and moderate temperatures**
- Not too hot even with warming
- Freshwater sources resilient
- Example regions: Azores, Faroe Islands, Falklands, Tierra del Fuego

**Pros:** Isolated, self-sufficient food possible, cooler climates
**Cons:** Remote, harsh weather, limited infrastructure

**3. Areas with resilient ecosystems**
- Biodiversity hotspots that adapt
- Regions with varied topography (multiple microclimates)
- Example regions: New Zealand (varied), Norway fjords, Chilean fjords

**Pros:** Nature provides food and resources
**Cons:** May attract others, subject to change

#### Climate Projections to Consider:

**By 2050-2100:**
- Equatorial regions: Potentially uninhabitable (wet bulb temperature >35°C)
- Coastal megacities: Flooding, abandonment
- Current breadbaskets: Drought, desertification
- Arctic/Antarctic: More accessible, warmer
- Mountain glaciers: Disappeared, affecting water supplies downstream

**Best bets for long-term habitability:**
- 40°-60° latitude (both hemispheres)
- Western coasts (cooler ocean currents)
- Islands with orographic rainfall (mountains creating rain)
- High elevation options (if going ashore)

#### Evaluation Questions:
- What are temperature projections for 2050, 2100?
- How reliable is freshwater under climate change?
- Is this area projected to get more or less rainfall?
- What's the cyclone/hurricane risk trend?
- How resilient are local ecosystems?
- Will this area attract climate refugees (competition for resources)?

### War Destinations

**What you need:**
- Neutral nations unlikely to be drawn into conflict
- Regions without strategic resources or importance
- Far from likely theaters of conflict
- Multiple departure routes (not trapped)

#### Top Destination Types:

**1. Officially neutral nations**
- Long history of neutrality
- Not in military alliances
- Example regions: Switzerland (landlocked), Iceland, Ireland, Austria

**Pros:** Won't be combatants, infrastructure maintained
**Cons:** May still be affected, could be overrun, immigration restrictions

**2. Southern Hemisphere remote regions**
- Far from likely Northern Hemisphere conflicts
- Little strategic importance
- Example regions: Southern Chile, Falklands, New Zealand, Tasmania, South Africa

**Pros:** Geographic distance from conflicts, stability
**Cons:** Still affected by global trade disruption, potential for resources to make them targets

**3. Extremely remote anchorages**
- No strategic value
- Difficult to access militarily
- Example regions: Sub-Antarctic islands, remote Pacific, Arctic

**Pros:** Ignored by militaries, autonomous
**Cons:** Harsh, isolated, survival challenging

#### Strategic Considerations:

**Avoid:**
- Chokepoints (Suez, Malacca Strait, Panama, Gibraltar, etc.)—likely conflict zones
- Major shipping lanes (targets for naval operations)
- Regions with strategic resources (oil, rare minerals)—likely invasion targets
- Bases and military installations
- Allied nations of combatants (may be drawn in)

**Favor:**
- Southern Hemisphere (most wars historically Northern Hemisphere)
- Mid-ocean islands (not strategic)
- Regions with no resources worth fighting over
- Areas with difficult military access

#### Nuclear Considerations:

If nuclear war occurs:
- **Immediate**: Avoid targets (cities, bases, industrial centers, silos)
- **Fallout**: Southern Hemisphere may be safer (less fallout crossing equator)
- **Nuclear winter**: Global temps drop, agriculture fails—no truly safe location
- **Best strategy**: Be at sea initially, then remote Southern Hemisphere

#### Evaluation Questions:
- Is this nation neutral or aligned with likely combatants?
- How strategically important is this region?
- Could this be a theater of conflict (e.g., South China Sea)?
- Can we depart quickly if war spreads?
- What's the nuclear target risk?

## Multi-Scenario Safe Harbors

Ideally, identify destinations that work for *multiple* scenarios. These are your highest-value targets.

### Example: Southern Patagonia (Chile)

**Economic collapse:** ✓ Local fishing/agriculture, not import-dependent
**Civil unrest:** ✓ Remote, low population, peaceful culture, easy to evade
**Climate collapse:** ✓ High latitude, cooler temps, abundant fresh water, resilient ecosystems
**War:** ✓ Southern Hemisphere, neutral Chile, no strategic importance

**Challenges:** Harsh weather, remote (resupply difficult), cold, sparse infrastructure

---

### Example: Vanuatu (Outer Islands)

**Economic collapse:** ✓ Subsistence economy, barter, local food abundant
**Civil unrest:** ✓ Peaceful culture, remote islands, no history of violence
**Climate collapse:** ⚠ Cyclone risk increasing, sea level rise, but rainy and fertile
**War:** ✓ No strategic importance, neutral, remote

**Challenges:** Cyclones, malaria, basic infrastructure, sea level vulnerable

---

### Example: New Zealand (South Island, Sounds)

**Economic collapse:** ⚠ Developed economy, but resilient, local food production possible
**Civil unrest:** ✓ Stable, cohesive society, rule of law, peaceful
**Climate collapse:** ✓ Temperate, fresh water, adaptable, high latitude
**War:** ✓ Neutral-ish (Five Eyes complicates), remote, Southern Hemisphere

**Challenges:** Immigration enforcement, expensive, may attract refugees, cyclone risk

---

## Strategic Positioning

**Don't wait for crisis to be on the wrong side of the world.**

### Positioning Strategy

**Level 1 (Monitoring):** Live normally but within striking distance of safe harbors
- Cruise in regions with good Level 3 options
- Don't go to dangerous areas just before collapse likely
- Example: If monitoring economic collapse, stay in Pacific or Caribbean with exit plans, not Mediterranean

**Level 2 (Enhanced Readiness):** Move toward safe harbor but don't commit
- Position in area where multiple destinations reachable
- Example: French Polynesia (can reach Patagonia, New Zealand, or remote Pacific)

**Level 3 (Activation):** Depart to chosen safe harbor
- Commit to destination based on which scenario unfolding
- Execute passage quickly

**Level 4 (Survival):** Relocate as needed based on evolving situation
- May move between anchorages in region
- Adapt to new information

### Positioning Principles:

1. **Know where you are:** Always know distance and routes to top 3 safe harbors

2. **Seasonal awareness:** Don't get trapped by cyclone seasons or monsoons

3. **Fuel and supplies:** Maintain ability to make long passage (e.g., 3,000+ nm) on short notice

4. **Weather windows:** Monitor long-range forecasts for passage opportunities

5. **Documentation:** Keep passports, ship's papers, clearances current—don't wait until you need to leave

## Routes and Passages

### Passage Planning for Crisis Departure

Your passages may need to be made under non-ideal conditions (wrong season, rushed prep, deteriorating global situation).

#### Multi-Level Route Planning:

**Ideal route (normal conditions):**
- Optimal weather windows
- Favorable currents and winds
- Safe harbors en route
- Example: Pacific crossing during typical season (April-October)

**Alternate route (if primary blocked or dangerous):**
- Different path avoiding threats
- May be longer or harder
- Example: Avoid conflict zone by going south

**Emergency route (rapid departure required):**
- Fastest/shortest even if difficult
- Minimal stops
- Example: Direct passage even if against prevailing winds

#### Route Considerations:

**Distance and time:**
- Can you make it on available fuel/food/water?
- Duration acceptable for crew (children, elderly)?

**Weather:**
- Seasonal patterns
- Tropical storm zones and seasons
- Prevailing winds (favorable or headwinds?)

**Stops en route:**
- Landfall options if needed
- Safe harbors for weather or emergencies
- Water/fuel availability

**Hazards:**
- Piracy zones
- Shipping lanes (congestion, collision risk)
- Navigational hazards (reefs, rocks)
- Political boundaries and hostile nations

**Communications:**
- Satellite coverage
- SSB propagation
- Emergency beacon coverage

#### Waypoints and Navigation:

- Pre-load routes in chartplotter
- Prepare paper charts for passages
- Identify celestial navigation capability for each route
- Document waypoints and courses

## Destination Portfolio

### Recommended Approach:

**Don't rely on a single destination.** Develop a portfolio of 5-10 potential safe harbors across scenarios and geographies.

**Example portfolio for Pacific-based cruiser:**

1. **Marquesas (French Polynesia)** - Economic collapse, remote, subsistence possible
2. **Patagonia (Chile)** - Multi-scenario, cold climate refuge
3. **Vanuatu (outer islands)** - Economic/unrest, tropical
4. **New Zealand (Fiordland)** - Multi-scenario, developed but remote
5. **Tonga** - Economic/unrest, peaceful culture
6. **Fiji (Lau Group)** - Remote tropical option
7. **Alaska (Southeast)** - Climate refuge, US territory if that matters
8. **Kiribati (outer atolls)** - Remote, subsistence, vulnerable to sea level
9. **Cook Islands (Southern)** - Peaceful, NZ relationship
10. **Falkland Islands** - War refuge, Southern Hemisphere, cold

**Each destination:**
- Addresses at least one scenario well
- Geographic diversity (not all in one area)
- Reachable from various positions
- Researched and documented

---

## Legal and Documentation Considerations

### Visas and Immigration:

**Normal times:**
- Research visa requirements for all destinations
- Some nations offer long-term cruising permits
- Maintain valid passports (renew early)

**Crisis times:**
- Enforcement may collapse (no one checking)
- Or may tighten (borders closed, paranoia)
- Have official clearance when possible but don't let lack of visa stop you in emergency

### Ship's Documentation:

- Registration current
- Radio licenses (FCC, MMSI)
- Proper flag and hailing port
- Liability insurance (if available and required)

**In crisis:**
- Documentation may not matter
- But having it prevents issues in stable areas
- Maintain it while possible

### Stateless Cruising:

**If governments collapse:**
- You may be effectively stateless
- No flag, no home port
- Rely on local tolerance or complete remoteness
- Precedent: Long-term cruisers in remote Pacific sometimes exist outside official systems

---

## Climate and Weather Routing

### Understanding Weather Patterns:

**Trade winds:**
- Steady easterlies in tropics (15°-30° latitude)
- Reliable for trade wind routes
- Seasonality important

**Westerlies:**
- Strong westerlies in higher latitudes (40°-60°)
- Fast passages east-to-west difficult
- Good for returning from Pacific to Americas

**Monsoons:**
- Seasonal wind reversals (Indian Ocean, SE Asia)
- Crucial for safe passages in these regions
- Dangerous if caught in wrong season

**Cyclone seasons:**
- Hurricanes/typhoons (June-November in Northern Hemisphere)
- Cyclones (November-April in Southern Hemisphere)
- Avoid being in cyclone zones during season

### Climate Change Impacts on Routing:

**Already observed:**
- Cyclones stronger and reaching higher latitudes
- Unpredictable seasons (earlier, later, longer)
- More extreme weather events

**Planning adjustments:**
- Widen safe margins for cyclone seasons
- Expect traditional weather patterns to be less reliable
- Need for faster departure (shorter weather windows)
