## Introduction

The P.A.C.E. planning framework—Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency—is a military-derived methodology that ensures you're never reliant on a single solution. By building redundancy into every critical system, you eliminate single points of failure that could prove catastrophic in a survival situation.

This chapter teaches you how to apply P.A.C.E. planning to every aspect of your maritime survival strategy.

## Understanding P.A.C.E. Planning

### The Four Levels

**Primary (P)**: Your main, most efficient, preferred solution
- Usually the most resource-efficient
- Optimal when available
- What you use 90% of the time

**Alternate (A)**: Secondary method when primary is unavailable
- Different methodology than primary
- Degraded efficiency but still good
- Ready to deploy quickly

**Contingency (C)**: Backup when both primary and alternate fail
- Significantly less efficient
- May require more effort/resources
- Tested and ready

**Emergency (E)**: Last-resort solution using minimal resources
- Bare-minimum functionality
- Highest effort, lowest efficiency
- Better than nothing

### Key Principles

1. **Independence**: Each level uses different methods/resources
   - If primary fails, the same failure shouldn't take out alternate

2. **Progressive degradation**: Each level is less efficient but more robust
   - Trade efficiency for resilience

3. **Pre-planned**: All levels designed and tested before crisis
   - No "figure it out when needed"

4. **Practiced**: Regular drills on alternate, contingency, emergency methods
   - Skills don't atrophy

5. **Resource allocation**: Stock supplies for all levels
   - Don't assume primary will always work

## Strategic Resource Allocation

### The Preparedness Pyramid

Not all scenarios are equally likely. Allocate resources accordingly:

**Foundation (80% of resources)**: Most likely scenarios, everyday use
- Water systems, food storage, basic medicine, navigation
- Overlap between scenarios
- Skills practiced regularly

**Middle (15% of resources)**: Less likely but serious scenarios
- Defense equipment, specialized medical, backup navigation
- Used occasionally or in higher threat levels
- Skills maintained through periodic practice

**Top (5% of resources)**: Unlikely but catastrophic scenarios
- Emergency rations, emergency beacons, liferaft, specialized survival gear
- Hopefully never used
- Skills known but rarely practiced

### Phased Preparation Approach

**Don't try to do everything at once.** Phased approach prevents burnout and financial strain.

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)**
- Priority: Water, food, basic safety
- Goals:
  - 30 days of water storage
  - 90 days of food storage
  - Basic medical kit
  - Safety equipment serviced
  - Family trained in basic boat operations
- Investment: Moderate (mostly provisions and maintenance)

**Phase 2: Redundancy (Months 4-6)**
- Priority: Build alternate systems
- Goals:
  - Watermaker or rain catchment operational
  - Fishing gear acquired and skills practiced
  - Medical training (WFA or WFR)
  - Backup navigation (paper charts, compass skills)
  - Communications (VHF, SSB/ham radio)
- Investment: Higher (equipment and training)

**Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Months 7-12)**
- Priority: Contingency and emergency levels
- Goals:
  - 12+ months food storage
  - Advanced medical kit and training
  - Security planning and equipment
  - Celestial navigation capability
  - Energy system expanded
  - Destination research completed
- Investment: Variable (depends on gaps)

**Phase 4: Optimization and Testing (Year 2+)**
- Priority: Practice, refine, maintain
- Goals:
  - Regular drills on all P.A.C.E. levels
  - Extended off-grid cruising to test systems
  - Skill maintenance and improvement
  - System upgrades based on experience
  - Continuous improvement
- Investment: Maintenance and upgrades

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Identify Risks

For each critical system, identify failure modes:

**Example: Water system risks**
- Watermaker failure
- Contamination of stored water
- Drought (no rain for catchment)
- Theft of water containers
- Hull damage causing storage loss
- Inability to access shore water

### Assess Probability and Impact

**Probability scale:**
1. Very unlikely (1% annual chance)
2. Unlikely (5% annual)
3. Possible (20% annual)
4. Likely (50% annual)
5. Very likely (>75% annual)

**Impact scale:**
1. Inconvenient (minor discomfort)
2. Challenging (requires adaptation)
3. Serious (significant hardship)
4. Critical (life-threatening if not resolved)
5. Catastrophic (immediate life threat)

**Risk score = Probability × Impact**

**Example:**
- Watermaker failure: Probability 3, Impact 3 = Risk 9 (moderate-high)
- All water systems failing simultaneously: Probability 1, Impact 5 = Risk 5 (low-moderate)

### Prioritize Mitigation

Focus mitigation on:
1. High probability + high impact (critical risks)
2. Low probability + catastrophic impact (existential risks)
3. High probability + moderate impact (quality of life risks)

**Mitigation strategies:**
- **Reduce probability**: Maintenance, training, quality equipment
- **Reduce impact**: Redundancy (P.A.C.E.), early detection, response plans
- **Transfer risk**: Insurance (when available), partnerships, community
- **Accept risk**: Some risks too low or costly to mitigate fully

## Integration Across Systems

### System Dependencies

Map how systems depend on each other:

**Example dependencies:**
- Medical care depends on: Water (hygiene), power (sterilization), light, reference books
- Food preservation depends on: Power (refrigeration), water (cleaning), security (prevent theft)
- Navigation depends on: Power, light, charts (physical or digital), knowledge
- Communications depend on: Power, antennas, propagation conditions

**Finding single points of failure:**
- **Power** supports many systems → Priority for redundancy
- **Knowledge** underlies all systems → Cross-training essential
- **Hull integrity** enables boat survival → Maintenance and damage control critical

**System cascade failures:**
- Power failure → Refrigeration fails → Food spoils → Rationing required → Morale drops
- Hull breach → Electrical systems damaged → Multiple dependent systems fail

**Mitigation:**
- Harden systems with many dependencies
- Cross-train all adults (and age-appropriately, children)
- Drill cascade failure scenarios

## Decision-Making Framework for Tradeoffs

Preparation involves constant tradeoffs: cost vs. benefit, efficiency vs. redundancy, space vs. capability.

### The Matrix Method

For any significant investment decision:

|  | Primary (P) | Alternate (A) | Contingency (C) | Emergency (E) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Current capability** | Describe current state | Describe current state | Describe current state | Describe current state |
| **Gap** | What's missing? | What's missing? | What's missing? | What's missing? |
| **Cost to close gap** | $ and effort | $ and effort | $ and effort | $ and effort |
| **Failure mode coverage** | What failures does this address? | What failures does this address? | What failures does this address? | What failures does this address? |
| **Priority** | Essential/High/Medium/Low | Essential/High/Medium/Low | Essential/High/Medium/Low | Essential/High/Medium/Low |

**Example: Medical care decision**

|  | Primary | Alternate | Contingency | Emergency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Current** | Basic first aid kit | None | None | None |
| **Gap** | Need comprehensive kit + telemedicine | Need WFR training | Need field medicine knowledge | Need trauma skills |
| **Cost** | $2000 kit + $50/mo satellite | $1000 + 1 week course | Books $200 + study time | Training course $300 |
| **Covers** | 80% of likely scenarios | Handles comms failure | Handles supply shortage | Handles life-threatening trauma |
| **Priority** | Essential | High | Medium | High |

**Decision**: Fund Primary and Emergency first (covers most likely and most serious), then Alternate, then Contingency.

## Testing and Drills

### Why Test Every Level?

**Primary** gets used daily—you know it works.

**Alternate, Contingency, Emergency** may not be used for months or years. When you need them, it's too late to discover they don't work or you've forgotten how.

### Drill Schedule

**Monthly**: Practice one alternate or contingency method
- Example: Use only rain catchment for water for a weekend
- Example: Navigate by paper chart and compass for a day

**Quarterly**: Full system failure drill
- Pick one critical system, simulate complete failure, use only C or E methods
- Example: Power failure—operate for 48 hours on manual/backup systems only

**Annually**: Multi-system cascade failure exercise
- Simulate major disaster, multiple systems compromised
- Example: Storm damage scenario—partial flooding, power loss, medical injury
- Family works through problems using P.A.C.E. plans

**After major changes**: Test affected systems
- New equipment installed? Test it and test what happens if it fails
- New crew/family member? They need practice with all levels

### Documentation

After each drill:
- What worked well?
- What failed or was harder than expected?
- What supplies were missing?
- What skills need improvement?
- Updates to P.A.C.E. plans?

Keep a drill log. Review annually to track improvement and identify patterns.

## Common Pitfalls in P.A.C.E. Planning

### Pitfall 1: Alternate is too similar to Primary

**Example**: Primary power is solar, Alternate is... more solar panels
- **Problem**: Same failure mode (clouds, damage) takes out both
- **Fix**: Alternate should be wind, fuel generator, or other independent source

### Pitfall 2: Contingency/Emergency not actually viable

**Example**: Emergency water plan is "we'll drink seawater"
- **Problem**: That kills you
- **Fix**: Realistic emergency plans only (rainwater, solar still, etc.)

### Pitfall 3: Resource depletion not considered

**Example**: Contingency relies on stored fuel that you burned through at Primary level
- **Problem**: When you need Contingency, resources are already gone
- **Fix**: Protected reserves for C and E levels, not shared with P and A

### Pitfall 4: Skill atrophy

**Example**: You learned celestial navigation 5 years ago but haven't practiced
- **Problem**: In a crisis, you can't remember how
- **Fix**: Regular practice of all levels

### Pitfall 5: False sense of security

**Example**: "We have a P.A.C.E. plan, so we're safe"
- **Problem**: Plans aren't magical; they require maintenance, resources, skills
- **Fix**: Continuous testing, improvement, resource management
