# Part V: Operational Protocols

## Overview

This section transforms all previous planning into actionable protocols. It provides the trigger-action matrix, drill schedules, and continuous improvement processes that make your survival plan a living, practiced reality rather than a static document.

## The Three Protocol Categories

1. **Trigger-Action Matrix** - When X happens, do Y
2. **Drills & Training** - Practice makes permanent
3. **Continuous Improvement** - Adapt and evolve

## Why Protocols Matter

**Decision paralysis prevention**: Pre-made decisions eliminate crisis indecision

**Skill retention**: Regular practice prevents skill atrophy

**Family coordination**: Everyone knows their role

**Adaptation**: Continuous improvement keeps plans relevant

**Confidence**: Practiced plans reduce fear and uncertainty

- Quarterly drills (full scenario exercises)
- Annual drills (multi-day survival simulation)
- Skill assessment and certification tracking

### [22. Continuous Improvement](22-continuous-improvement.md) ⚠️ DRAFT

Review, adapt, and improve survival plans over time.

## Integration

Part V integrates all previous parts:

**Part I triggers Part V**: Threat assessment determines which protocols activate

**Part II tested through Part V**: Core systems drilled regularly

**Part III developed via Part V**: Skills practiced on schedule

**Part IV executed by Part V**: Scenario responses practiced and refined
