## Why These Skills Matter

Navigation and seamanship are the foundation of maritime survival. When electronic systems failwhether from EMP, power loss, or simple equipment failurethese skills become the difference between reaching safety and disaster. In collapse scenarios, GPS satellites may be destroyed, power grids will fail, and electronic charts become inaccessible. Your ability to navigate by sun, stars, and compass, and to handle your vessel in all conditions, determines your family's survival.

**Critical Scenarios**:

- GPS failure during ocean passage
- Electronic chart plotter loss in unfamiliar waters
- Storm approach requiring immediate heavy weather tactics
- Engine failure requiring expert sail handling
- Need to navigate to safe haven without external assistance
- Avoiding collision without radar or AIS

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Navigation Errors

1. **Forgetting variation and deviation** - Always apply compass corrections
2. **Ignoring current and leeway** - These accumulate significantly over time
3. **Poor sight timing** - Celestial bodies move; timing is critical
4. **Sextant handling** - Keep mirrors clean, check index error daily
5. **Over-reliance on single method** - Always use multiple position sources
6. **Inadequate chart scale** - Large-scale charts essential near shore
7. **Mixing units** - Confusion between nautical/statute miles, feet/fathoms/meters

### Seamanship Errors

1. **Delaying reefing** - "First thought of reefing = time to reef"
2. **Insufficient sea room** - Always maintain escape routes from lee shores
3. **Poor storm preparation timing** - Setup before conditions deteriorate
4. **Wrong heavy weather tactic** - Each boat behaves differently; know yours
5. **Inadequate anchor scope** - Minimum 5:1, prefer 7:1 in storms
6. **Ignoring chafe** - The #1 cause of gear failure in storms
7. **Crew fatigue** - Heaving-to for rest can save lives
