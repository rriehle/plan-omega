# Part III: Knowledge & Skills

## Overview

Equipment and supplies eventually run out or fail. Knowledge and skills are the only truly sustainable resources--they cannot be depleted, stolen, or destroyed (short of death or injury). This section covers critical capabilities that enable long-term survival and autonomy.

## The Five Knowledge Domains

1. **Education** - Children's learning and development
2. **Navigation** - Finding your way without modern electronics
3. **Communication** - Staying connected and informed
4. **Tools & Equipment** - Making, maintaining, and improvising gear
5. **Local Integration** - Building relationships and trading with communities

## Why Skills Matter

**Sustainability**: Food runs out, but fishing skills produce food indefinitely

**Adaptability**: Plans fail, but improvisational skills solve unexpected problems

**Resilience**: Equipment breaks, but repair skills keep systems functional

**Independence**: Supply chains fail, but fabrication skills create needed items

**Community**: Money loses value, but skilled labor always trades

## Skill Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Essential Skills (First 6 months)

- Basic seamanship (all family members)
- Navigation fundamentals (chart reading, compass)
- Basic fishing
- Simple repairs (sewing, basic tools)
- First aid

### Phase 2: Intermediate Skills (6-18 months)

- Advanced navigation (celestial, piloting)
- Diverse fishing techniques
- Equipment repair (mechanical, electrical)
- Food preservation
- Radio communication

### Phase 3: Advanced Skills (18+ months)

- Master-level seamanship
- Complex fabrication and repair
- Local language and cultural fluency
- Advanced medical skills
- Teaching (passing knowledge to children)
