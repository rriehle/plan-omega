# Part III: Knowledge & Skills

## Overview

Equipment and supplies eventually run out or fail. Knowledge and skills are the only truly sustainable resources—they cannot be depleted, stolen, or destroyed (short of death or injury). This section covers critical capabilities that enable long-term survival and autonomy.

## The Five Knowledge Domains

1. **Education** - Children's learning and development
2. **Navigation** - Finding your way without modern electronics
3. **Communication** - Staying connected and informed
4. **Tools & Equipment** - Making, maintaining, and improvising gear
5. **Local Integration** - Building relationships and trading with communities

## Why Skills Matter

**Sustainability**: Food runs out, but fishing skills produce food indefinitely

**Adaptability**: Plans fail, but improvisational skills solve unexpected problems

**Resilience**: Equipment breaks, but repair skills keep systems functional

**Independence**: Supply chains fail, but fabrication skills create needed items

**Community**: Money loses value, but skilled labor always trades

## Skill Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Essential Skills (First 6 months)
- Basic seamanship (all family members)
- Navigation fundamentals (chart reading, compass)
- Basic fishing
- Simple repairs (sewing, basic tools)
- First aid

### Phase 2: Intermediate Skills (6-18 months)
- Advanced navigation (celestial, piloting)
- Diverse fishing techniques
- Equipment repair (mechanical, electrical)
- Food preservation
- Radio communication

### Phase 3: Advanced Skills (18+ months)
- Master-level seamanship
- Complex fabrication and repair
- Local language and cultural fluency
- Advanced medical skills
- Teaching (passing knowledge to children)
