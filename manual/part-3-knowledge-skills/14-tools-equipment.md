## Why These Skills Matter

When you're 1,000 miles from the nearest harbor and something breaks, your survival depends on your ability to fix it. In collapse scenarios, marine chandlers close, supply chains fail, and professional help becomes unavailable. The difference between reaching safety and abandoning ship often comes down to a $20 part you can repair or a skill you've practiced. Statistics show 60% of Atlantic crossing boats experience equipment failure; 14% have major autopilot failures mid-ocean. Your repair skills and tool inventory directly determine whether these failures are inconveniences or catastrophes.

**Critical Reality Check**: 50% of boats that sink do so from failed underwater fittingsentirely preventable with proper maintenance and repair skills.

   - **Cause**: Clogged filters (90%), air in system, diesel bug
   - **Fix**: Change filters, bleed system, biocide treatment
   - **Prevention**: Monthly filter checks, fuel polishing

2. **Cooling System**
   - **Symptom**: Overheating alarm
   - **Cause**: Failed impeller, clogged intake, broken belt
   - **Fix**: Replace impeller (can fail in minutes!)
   - **Prevention**: 200-hour impeller changes, daily belt checks

3. **Electrical**
   - **Symptom**: Intermittent failures, dead circuits
   - **Cause**: Corrosion (90%), NOT shorts
   - **Fix**: Clean and re-crimp connections
   - **Prevention**: Dielectric grease, heat shrink everything

### Critical Through-Hull Failures (50% of sinkings)

- **Seized seacocks**: Exercise monthly
- **Dezincification**: Replace bronze with Marelon
- **Hose failure**: Double-clamp everything
- **Gate valve failure**: Never use gate valves below waterline

## Emergency Repair Techniques

### Jury Steering (When rudder fails)

**Method 1: Drogue Steering** (Most reliable)

- Deploy drogue from quarter
- Adjust bridle to steer
- Achieves 1.5 knots but very stable

**Method 2: Pole and Board** (Fastest)

- Lash spinnaker pole to stern
- Attach floorboard or cabinet door
- Can achieve 3-4 knots

**Method 3: Sail Balance** (Simplest)

- Twin headsails or main/headsail balance
- Requires constant adjustment
- Works only in steady conditions

### Hull Breach Repair

**Immediate**:

1. Stuff with cushions/sails
2. Cover with collision mat
3. Brace with floorboards

**Temporary** (Hours):

1. Underwater epoxy from inside
2. Plywood backing plate
3. Multiple layers of 5200

**Permanent** (Days):

1. Haul out or careen
2. Proper fiberglass repair
3. Multiple layers with mat and cloth

## Proficiency Assessment

You're ready when you can:

- [ ] Diagnose why diesel won't start (15 minutes)
- [ ] Replace impeller in darkness (20 minutes)
- [ ] Find electrical fault with multimeter (30 minutes)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Fatal Errors

1. **Using automotive parts** - Marine environment destroys them
2. **Skipping double-clamps** - Single point of failure below waterline
3. **Ignoring chafe** - #1 cause of rigging failure
4. **Mixing metals** - Galvanic corrosion destroys fittings
5. **Postponing maintenance** - Small problems become emergencies

### Skill Development Errors

1. **Not practicing in good conditions** - Learn when it's calm
2. **Relying on one person's knowledge** - Everyone must know basics
3. **Ignoring manufacturer specs** - Torque matters
4. **Substituting materials** - Marine grade exists for reasons
5. **Rushing repairs** - "Measure twice, cut once"
