## About This Index

This appendix provides a catalog of all planning and tracking templates included with this manual. These templates have been consolidated from the original Appendix D into standalone files in the `planning-templates` directory for easier access, customization, and version control.

**Note on Consolidation:** As of November 2025, all document templates previously embedded in this appendix have been extracted into individual markdown files. This allows you to:

- Copy and customize templates without modifying the manual
- Print only the templates you need
- Maintain digital and paper copies separately
- Version-control your completed templates independently
- Share specific templates with crew members

## Usage Guidelines

### Accessing Templates

All templates are located in: `manual/planning-templates/`

Each template is a standalone markdown file that can be:

- Opened in any text editor
- Converted to PDF for printing
- Copied and customized for your needs
- Version-controlled separately from the manual

### Printing and Storage

1. **Print multiple copies** - Keep blank templates aboard for future use
2. **Laminate frequent-use forms** - Daily logs, watch schedules, and drill reports work well with dry-erase markers
3. **Create binders** - Organize by category with dividers:
   - Operational (daily logs, watch schedules, inventory)
   - Planning (passages, destinations, scenarios)
   - Safety (drills, threat assessments, audits)
   - Medical (health records)
   - Administrative (family plans, maintenance schedules)
4. **Weatherproof storage** - Use waterproof bags or containers
5. **Digital backups** - Scan completed forms periodically and store in multiple locations

### Best Practices

1. **Consistency** - Use the same forms every time to build muscle memory
2. **Completeness** - Fill out all sections; use "N/A" when not applicable
3. **Legibility** - Print clearly or type if possible
4. **Signatures** - Sign and date all forms for accountability
5. **Review** - Regularly review past records for patterns and trends
6. **Update** - Revise templates as your needs and systems change
7. **Train** - Use forms as training tools for all crew members

### Integration with Manual

These templates support the protocols described throughout the manual:

- **Daily Log** supports continuous monitoring (Chapter 22)
- **Inventory Tracking** supports P.A.C.E. planning (Chapter 3)
- **Maintenance Schedule** supports vessel systems (Chapter 7)
- **Drill Reports** support training protocols (Chapter 21)
- **Threat Assessment** supports monitoring systems (Chapter 2)
- **Destination Dossier** supports navigation planning (Chapter 4)
- **Passage Planning** supports seamanship (Chapter 12)
- **Medical Records** support healthcare systems (Chapter 9)
- **Watch Schedules** support operational protocols (Chapter 20)
- **P.A.C.E. Planning** supports all core systems (Chapters 5-10)
- **Scenario Response** supports scenario planning (Part IV)
- **System Audit** supports quarterly reviews (Chapter 22)
- **Family Emergency Plan** supports crew coordination (Chapter 20)

### Customization

Feel free to modify these templates for your specific:

- Vessel type and size
- Crew composition and experience levels
- Operating region and climate
- Specific scenarios you're preparing for
- Personal preferences and workflows

The key is **consistent use** - templates are only valuable if used regularly and completely. Start with the forms most relevant to your current needs, then expand usage as they become part of your routine.

### Digital vs. Paper

**Advantages of paper:**

- No power required
- Immune to electronic failure
- Easy to share among crew
- Fast access in emergencies
- Legal record (signatures)

**Advantages of digital:**

- Easy to backup and duplicate
- Searchable and analyzable
- Can include photos and data
- Easy to share remotely
- Version control

**Recommendation:** Maintain both. Use paper for real-time logging and immediate access; scan to digital for backup, analysis, and long-term storage.

## Template Development

The templates in this collection were developed from:

1. Professional maritime industry standards
2. Medical emergency protocols
3. Military planning frameworks (especially P.A.C.E. methodology)
4. Lessons learned from blue-water cruisers
5. Emergency management best practices
6. Family preparedness programs

They have been adapted specifically for families living aboard vessels in long-term survival scenarios, with emphasis on:

- Simplicity and clarity under stress
- Flexibility for various vessel types
- Scalability from couples to larger families
- Integration with the manual's four-level threat system
- Child-appropriate adaptations
