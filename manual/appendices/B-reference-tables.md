## 1. Nautical Calculations and Conversions

### 1.1 Distance Conversions

| From | To | Multiply by |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Nautical Miles | Statute Miles | 1.15078 |
| Nautical Miles | Kilometers | 1.852 |
| Statute Miles | Nautical Miles | 0.8690 |
| Kilometers | Nautical Miles | 0.5400 |

**Key Fact:** One nautical mile equals exactly one minute of latitude (1/60th of a degree).

#### Quick Reference Table

| Nautical Miles | Statute Miles | Kilometers |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | 1.15 | 1.85 |
| 5 | 5.75 | 9.26 |
| 10 | 11.51 | 18.52 |
| 25 | 28.77 | 46.30 |
| 50 | 57.54 | 92.60 |
| 100 | 115.08 | 185.20 |
| 500 | 575.39 | 926.00 |

### 1.2 Speed Conversions

| Knots | MPH | KM/H | Typical Use |
|-------|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | 1.15 | 1.85 | Drifting |
| 3 | 3.45 | 5.56 | Slow sailing |
| 5 | 5.75 | 9.26 | Light wind sailing |
| 7 | 8.06 | 12.96 | Moderate sailing |
| 10 | 11.51 | 18.52 | Good sailing speed |
| 15 | 17.26 | 27.78 | Fast sailing |
| 20 | 23.02 | 37.04 | Motor cruising |

**Definition:** One knot = one nautical mile per hour

### 1.3 Distance to Horizon

**Formula:** Distance (NM) = 1.17 × √(height of eye in feet)

| Height of Eye (feet) | Distance to Horizon (NM) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 3 | 2.0 |
| 6 | 2.9 |
| 10 | 3.7 |
| 15 | 4.5 |
| 20 | 5.2 |
| 30 | 6.4 |
| 50 | 8.3 |
| 100 | 11.7 |

### 1.4 Speed-Time-Distance Formulas

**Basic Formulas:**
- Distance (NM) = Speed (knots) × Time (hours)
- Speed (knots) = Distance (NM) ÷ Time (hours)
- Time (hours) = Distance (NM) ÷ Speed (knots)

**"60 D Street" Rule (for minutes):**
- 60D = ST
- Distance (NM) = (Speed × Time in minutes) ÷ 60

#### Quick Calculation Table (Minutes to Cover Distance)

| Speed (knots) | 1 NM | 5 NM | 10 NM | 25 NM |
|---------------|------|------|-------|-------|
| 3 | 20 min | 100 min | 200 min | 500 min |
| 5 | 12 min | 60 min | 120 min | 300 min |
| 7 | 8.6 min | 43 min | 86 min | 214 min |
| 10 | 6 min | 30 min | 60 min | 150 min |
| 15 | 4 min | 20 min | 40 min | 100 min |

### 1.5 Fuel Consumption

**Simplified Estimation:**
- Gasoline engines: GPH ≈ Total HP ÷ 10 (at wide open throttle)
- Diesel engines: GPH ≈ Total HP × 0.06 (at wide open throttle)

*Note: Cruising speed typically uses 60-80% of WOT fuel consumption.*

#### Typical Fuel Consumption by Vessel Type

| Vessel Type | Size | Consumption | Speed |
|-------------|------|------------|-------|
| Sailboat (auxiliary) | 30-40 ft | 0.5-1.0 GPH | 5-7 knots |
| Sailboat (auxiliary) | 40-50 ft | 1.5-2.5 GPH | 6-8 knots |
| Trawler (displacement) | 40-50 ft | 2-4 GPH | 7-9 knots |
| Small Motor Yacht | Under 40 ft | 5-8 GPH | 15-20 knots |

### 1.6 Compass Conversions

**TVMDC Formula:** True, Variation, Magnetic, Deviation, Compass

**Memory Aid:** "East is Least, West is Best" (when converting from compass to true)
- East variation/deviation: ADD to true, SUBTRACT from compass
- West variation/deviation: SUBTRACT from true, ADD to compass

**Converting Compass to True:**
True Course = Compass Course + Variation + Deviation
(Where East = positive, West = negative)

## 6. Electrical Calculations

### 6.1 Ohm's Law Formulas

**Power Formulas:**
- Watts (W) = Volts (V) × Amps (A)
- Amps (A) = Watts (W) ÷ Volts (V)
- Volts (V) = Watts (W) ÷ Amps (A)

**Resistance Formulas:**
- Volts (V) = Amps (A) × Ohms (Ω)
- Amps (A) = Volts (V) ÷ Ohms (Ω)
- Ohms (Ω) = Volts (V) ÷ Amps (A)

**Practical 12V DC Examples:**
- 100W light bar: 100W ÷ 12V = 8.33A
- 3W LED light: 3W ÷ 12V = 0.25A
- 300W device: 300W ÷ 12V = 25A

### 6.2 Battery Capacity

**Formulas:**
- Amp-Hours (Ah) = Amps × Hours
- Watt-Hours (Wh) = Watts × Hours
- Watt-Hours (Wh) = Amp-Hours (Ah) × Volts

**Runtime Formula:**
Runtime (hours) = Battery Capacity (Ah) × Battery Voltage (V) ÷ Device Load (W)

**Battery Bank Sizing:**
Battery Bank Capacity = Daily Consumption (Ah) × 3 to 4

**Depth of Discharge (DoD) Limits:**
- **Lead-Acid/AGM:** Use only 50% of capacity maximum
- **Lithium (LiFePO4):** Can use 80-100% of capacity
- Usable Capacity = Total Capacity × DoD Percentage

### 6.3 Wire Gauge Selection (12V DC, 3% Voltage Drop)

| Wire Length (ft) | 5A | 10A | 15A | 20A | 25A | 30A | 40A | 50A |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 10 | 18 | 14 | 12 | 10 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 6 |
| 15 | 16 | 12 | 10 | 10 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 4 |
| 20 | 14 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 4 |
| 25 | 14 | 10 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 4 |
| 30 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 2 |
| 40 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 2 |
| 50 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 |

**Note:** Smaller AWG numbers = larger wire diameter. Wire length = round-trip distance (battery to load and back).

**Voltage Drop Standards:**
- **Critical circuits** (navigation, bilge pumps, emergency): **3% maximum**
- **Non-critical circuits** (cabin lights, other): **10% maximum**

### 6.5 Solar Panel Sizing

**Basic Formula:**
Required Solar Wattage = (Daily Ah × System Voltage × 1.4) ÷ Peak Sun Hours

**Realistic Daily Output:**
- **On passage (sailing):** Rated Watts × 5 hours ÷ 12V = Daily Ah
- **At anchor:** Rated Watts × 7 hours ÷ 12V = Daily Ah

**Example:** 400W panel at anchor: 400W × 7 ÷ 12 = 233 Ah/day

#### Solar Array Sizing Guide

| Daily Consumption | Solar Array Size | Battery Bank (LiFePO4) |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 60 Ah/day | 100-150W | 200 Ah |
| 100 Ah/day | 200-300W | 300 Ah |
| 150 Ah/day | 350-500W | 400-500 Ah |
| 200 Ah/day | 500-700W | 500-600 Ah |

### 6.6 Battery Charging

## 9. Essential Knots

### 9.1 Top 5 Essential Maritime Knots

Every sailor must know these knots cold. Practice until you can tie them in the dark, in rough seas, and with cold hands.

#### 1. Bowline
**Use:** Creates a fixed loop that won't slip or bind
**Strength:** 70-75% of rope strength
**Applications:** Securing sheets, making rescue loops, tying to rings/posts
**Memory Aid:** "The rabbit comes out of the hole, around the tree, and back down the hole"

#### 2. Figure 8 Loop
**Use:** Stronger alternative to bowline
**Strength:** 75-80% of rope strength
**Applications:** Tie-in point for safety lines, rescue loops, attachment to hardware
**Advantage:** Easy to inspect, won't come undone, very strong

#### 3. Clove Hitch
**Use:** Quick temporary attachment to posts, rails, or other lines
**Strength:** 60-65% of rope strength
**Applications:** Fender lines, temporary mooring, securing to lifelines
**Warning:** Not reliable under variable load or on smooth surfaces

#### 4. Round Turn and Two Half Hitches
**Use:** Securing to posts, rings, or rails
**Strength:** 65-70% of rope strength
**Applications:** Docking lines, securing fenders, tying to anchors
**Advantage:** Easy to tie and adjust under load

#### 5. Sheet Bend (and Double Sheet Bend)
**Use:** Joining two ropes, especially of different diameters
**Strength:** 40-45% (single), 50-55% (double)
**Applications:** Extending lines, creating longer dock lines
**Warning:** Not for critical loads; use double sheet bend for security

### 9.2 Critical Safety Reminders

1. **All knots reduce rope strength by 25-60%**
2. **Splices are always stronger than knots (90-95% strength)**
3. **Never use square knots for critical loads** - dangerous under load
4. **Inspect knots regularly** - UV, chafe, and salt degrade knots
5. **Know your knots cold** - practice until automatic
6. **Use correct knot for application** - wrong knot = potential failure

## Quick Reference Summary

### Essential Formulas

```
DISTANCE & SPEED:
Distance (NM) = Speed (knots) × Time (hours)
Speed (knots) = Distance (NM) ÷ Time (hours)
60D = ST (for calculations in minutes)

ELECTRICAL:
Watts = Volts × Amps
Amps = Watts ÷ Volts
Battery Bank = Daily Ah × 3-4
DC Amps from AC = (AC Watts × 1.1) ÷ DC Volts

WATER & FOOD:
Minimum water: 1-3 L/day depending on temperature
Minimum calories: 1500-2500/day depending on activity
```

### Critical Numbers to Remember

- **1 nautical mile = 1 minute of latitude**
