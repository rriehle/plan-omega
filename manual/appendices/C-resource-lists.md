**Best Practice:** Before each major passage or entering new region:
1. Update electronic charts
2. Download latest cruising guide information from Noonsite
3. Verify radio net schedules
4. Check security situation
5. Confirm SAR and medical consultation contact methods work
6. Update embassy contact information
7. Review insurance coverage and contact methods
