## 1. FIRE EMERGENCY

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First 60 Seconds)

**ALERT:**

- Shout "FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!" + location + type
- Sound general alarm (7+ short + 1 long blast)
- VHF Channel 16: "MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY" (if severe)

**ASSESS:**

- Location: ______________________
- Type:  Electrical  Fuel  Galley  Engine  Other
- Size:  Small (contained)  Spreading  Out of control

### DECISION MATRIX

| Fire Type | First Action | DO NOT USE WATER |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Electrical** | Cut power at main breaker | NEVER - Electrocution risk |
| **Fuel/Engine** | Shut fuel valves, close compartment | NEVER - Spreads fire |
| **Galley (grease)** | Smother with lid/blanket | NEVER - Explosive |
| **Materials** | Water or ABC extinguisher | Safe to use |

### FIRE EXTINGUISHER PROCEDURE (P.A.S.S.)

1. **P**ull pin
2. **A**im at base of fire (not flames)
3. **S**queeze handle
4. **S**weep side to side

**Extinguisher Locations:** _________________________________

### FIRE CLASSIFICATIONS

- **Class A:** Wood, paper, cloth -> Water or ABC
- **Class B:** Gasoline, oil, grease -> BC or ABC (NEVER WATER)
- **Class C:** Electrical -> BC or ABC (cut power first)
- **Class K:** Galley grease -> Smother or K-type

### ENGINE ROOM FIRE PROTOCOL

1. **Shut down immediately:** Fuel valves OFF, engine stop
2. **Close all openings:** Vents, hatches, companionway
3. **Deploy fixed system:** Activate automatic suppression if equipped
4. **Do NOT open for 15+ minutes:** Starve fire of oxygen
5. **Monitor temperature:** Touch door/bulkheadif hot, don't open

### ABANDON SHIP CRITERIA

**Abandon if:**

- Fire out of control after 5 minutes
- Fire reaches fuel tanks or propane
- Vessel integrity compromised
- Crew safety at immediate risk

**Before abandoning:**

- Deploy EPIRB
- Broadcast MAYDAY with position

- Rate:  Slow seep  Steady stream  Rapid  Catastrophic
- Source:  Hull breach  Through-hull  Hose  Stuffing box  Unknown

### STOP THE WATER

**Priority Order:**

1. **Close through-hulls** in affected area (if source)
2. **Plug the hole:**
   - Small (<1"): Wooden plugs, rags, collision mat
   - Medium (1-3"): Collision mat, cushion, mattress (external)
   - Large (>3"): Mattress secured with lines over side
3. **Reduce flow:** Anything that slows water = more time

**Collision Mat Deployment:**

- Center over hole on OUTSIDE of hull
- Secure with lines under hull, tension from deck
- Water pressure will help hold in place

### PUMP STRATEGY

**P.A.C.E. Pumping:**

1. **PRIMARY:** Electric bilge pumps (check circuit breaker)
2. **ALTERNATE:** Manual bilge pump (all crew rotate 15-min shifts)
3. **CONTINGENCY:** Buckets (2 gallons/bucket = 120 gph if continuous)
4. **EMERGENCY:** Engine cooling intake (pump overboard)

**Pump Locations:**

- Electric bilge pump: _______________________
- Manual pump: ____________________________
- Emergency manual pump: __________________

### PRIORITIZE & PREPARE

**While pumping:**

- Move heavy items away from flooded area
- Secure critical equipment above waterline
- Prepare abandon ship bag
- Update position and send PAN-PAN if worsening
- Head for nearest shore (if safe and pumps keeping up)

### ABANDON DECISION

**Abandon if:**

- Water level rising despite all pumps
- Boat settling/listing dangerously
- Structural integrity failing
- Less than 15 minutes to sinking (estimate)

---

## 3. MAN OVERBOARD (MOB)

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First 10 Seconds)

**SHOUT:** "MAN OVERBOARD! [PORT/STARBOARD] SIDE!"

**THROW:**

- Life ring with drogue/line
- Anything that floats to mark spot
- Throwable flotation (cushions, fenders)

**DESIGNATE SPOTTER:**

- One person does NOTHING but point at person in water
- Never take eyes off themno exceptions

**PRESS MOB BUTTON:** On GPS/chartplotter

### RECOVERY MANEUVERS

#### Quick-Stop Method (Most Boats)

1. **Immediately turn toward side person fell from**
2. **Slow or stop boat** (engine in neutral if sailing)
3. **Circle back,** approaching from downwind
4. **Stop alongside** person (not ahead/behind)

#### Figure-8 / Williamson Turn (Power Vessels)

1. **Hard over rudder** toward side person went over
2. **Shift rudder** when heading 60 deg off original
3. **Steadies on reciprocal** heading back to person
4. **Slow and approach** from downwind

### IN-WATER RESCUE

**Approach:**

- Engine in NEUTRAL before person near stern
- Approach downwind (drift toward them)
- Throw line before alongside

**Hoisting Methods:**

- **Conscious, able:** Swim ladder
- **Conscious, weak:** Halyard + harness
- **Unconscious:** Halyard + multiple crew (600 lb rescue lift)
- **Emergency:** 4:1 tackle from boom

### HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL

**Water Temp vs. Time:**

- 50 degF (10 degC): 1-3 hours survival
- 60 degF (15 degC): 2-7 hours survival
- 70 degF (21 degC): 3-12 hours survival
- 80 degF (27 degC): Indefinite if conscious

**After Rescue:**

- Remove wet clothing
- Dry and insulate (survival blanket/sleeping bag)
- Warm core first (chest, head)
- Warm, sweet drinks if conscious
- Monitor for shock
- Seek medical attention (even if seems OK)

### IF PERSON NOT RECOVERED WITHIN 15 MINUTES

**Deploy full search:**

1. Mark last known position (MOB button)
2. **MAYDAY broadcast** with position
3. Deploy EPIRB if offshore
4. Continue search pattern (expanding square)
5. Request Coast Guard/SAR assistance

**Search Pattern:**

- Start at MOB position
- Expanding square: 0.5nm legs, increasing each circuit
- Account for wind/current drift

---

## 4. ABANDON SHIP

### PREPARE TO ABANDON CRITERIA

**Abandon ONLY if:**

- Vessel sinking and cannot be saved
- Fire out of control and risk of explosion
- Catastrophic structural failure

## 5. MEDICAL EMERGENCIES - CPR

### ADULT CPR (Ages 12+)

**Check Response:**

- Tap shoulders: "Are you okay?"
- No response = START CPR

**C-A-B Sequence:**

**C = COMPRESSIONS (30)**

- Hand position: Center of chest, between nipples
- Depth: 2 to 2.4 inches (5-6 cm)
- Rate: 100-120 per minute (beat of "Stayin' Alive")
- Allow full chest recoil between compressions
- Minimize interruptions (<10 seconds)

**A = AIRWAY**

- Head-tilt, chin-lift (if no spinal injury)
- Look for obstruction, remove if visible

**B = BREATHS (2)**

- Pinch nose, seal mouth over theirs
- Breath for 1 second, watch chest rise
- If no rise, reposition head and try again
- Two breaths, then back to compressions

**CONTINUE:** 30 compressions : 2 breaths

- Until AED arrives, person revives, or exhausted
- Switch compressors every 2 minutes (fatigue reduces quality)

### CHILD CPR (Ages 1-12)

**Same as adult, but:**

- Compressions: 2 inches (5 cm) depth
- Can use one hand if small child
- Same 30:2 ratio if alone
- 15:2 ratio if two rescuers present

### INFANT CPR (Under 1 Year)

**Compressions:**

- Two fingers on center of chest (just below nipple line)
- Depth: 1.5 inches (4 cm)
- Rate: 100-120 per minute
- 30:2 ratio (15:2 if two rescuers)

**Breaths:**

- Cover infant's mouth AND nose with your mouth
- Gentle puffs (smaller breaths than adult)
- Watch for chest rise

### WHEN TO STOP CPR

**Continue until:**

- Person shows signs of life (breathing, moving)
- AED is ready to analyze
- Professional help arrives
- Scene becomes unsafe
- You are too exhausted to continue (swap with another rescuer)

**If person revives:**

- Place in recovery position (side-lying)
- Monitor breathing continuously
- Keep warm
- Seek medical attention ASAP

- Continue until object expelled or person unconscious

### UNCONSCIOUS CHOKING

**If person becomes unconscious:**

1. **Lower to ground safely**
2. **Call for help** (radio for assistance)
3. **BEGIN CPR** (chest compressions may dislodge object)
4. **Before each breath:** Look in mouth, remove object if visible
5. **Never blind finger sweep** in children (may push object deeper)

### INFANT CHOKING (Under 1 Year)

**5 BACK BLOWS**

1. Support head/neck, face down on your forearm
2. Head lower than chest
3. Strike between shoulder blades with heel of hand (5 times)

**5 CHEST THRUSTS**

## 8. STORM TACTICS

### HEAVY WEATHER DECISION MATRIX

| Wind Speed | Seas | Tactics | Sail Config |
|------------|------|---------|-------------|
| 20-30 kts | 6-10 ft | Reef early, maintain control | 1-2 reefs, working jib |
| 30-40 kts | 10-15 ft | Heave-to or reduced sail | Deep reef or storm sails |
| 40-50 kts | 15-20 ft | Heave-to, sea anchor, or run | Storm jib + trysail only |
| 50+ kts | 20+ ft | Survival: run-off or sea anchor | Bare poles or storm jib |

### HEAVING-TO PROCEDURE

**Best for:** Waiting out storm, rest, repairs, crew break

**Setup:**

1. **Tack but don't release jib** (backwind it)
2. **Sheet jib to weather** (opposite side from normal)
3. **Trim mainsail** (reefed or trysail)
4. **Lash helm to leeward** (rudder turns boat into wind)

**Result:** Boat drifts slowly forward and to lee at 1-2 knots, bow 40-50 deg off wind, relatively stable

**Best for:** Fin keel boats may lie beam-to (dangerous)test in moderate conditions first

### RUNNING BEFORE THE STORM

**When:** Need sea room and want to make distance

**Procedure:**

1. **Stern to waves**
2. **Reduced sail or bare poles**
3. **Trail warps/drogue** to slow boat (prevents surfing/pitchpole)
4. **Active steering** required (keep stern to waves)
5. **Watch for following seas** (risk of breaking waves over stern)

**Warps:** Trail 300+ ft of heavy line in bights off stern quarters (slows boat, adds drag)

**Drogue:** Purpose-built sea drogue for controlled speed reduction

### SEA ANCHOR DEPLOYMENT

**When:** Lying ahull, need bow into waves, no sea room to run

**Setup:**

1. **Deploy from bow** (or bridle from both bows)
2. **100-300 ft line** (match boat size)
3. **Trip line** attached (for retrieval)
4. **Boat lies bow to wind/waves**
5. **Drift 1-2 knots downwind**

**Best for:** Deep-keel boats, offshore storms with no land danger

### STORM PREPARATION (Before Weather Hits)

**Deck:**

-  All loose gear below or lashed
-  Storm sails ready/bent on
-  Jack lines rigged
-  Life lines checked
-  Hatches dogged/secured
-  Ventilators sealed or removed

**Below:**

-  All heavy items secured
-  Lee cloths rigged
-  Bilges pumped
-  Stove gimballed and secure
-  Emergency gear accessible
-  Everything that can fall secured

**Safety:**

-  Everyone in life jackets
-  Safety harnesses on deck
-  Tethers short (stay inboard)
-  Ditch bag ready (don't need to abandon, but ready)
-  EPIRB accessible

**Navigation:**

-  Position plotted and updated
-  Sea room assessed (hazards to lee?)
-  Alternatives identified
-  Broadcast PAN-PAN if appropriate

### CRITICAL STORM RULES

**The One Golden Rule:** **AVOID BREAKING WAVES**

- Breaking wave height of your beam width can capsize
- Avoid beam-to orientation
- If wave breaks on you, brace and hold on

**Other Rules:**

- Reef early, reef often (overpowered = dangerous)
- Rest crew before exhaustion (heave-to for breaks)
- Maintain positive crew morale
- Keep watch (collision risk with shipping)
- Stay hydrated and fed (even if seasick)

## 9. DISTRESS SIGNALS & COMMUNICATION

### DISTRESS HIERARCHY

**MAYDAY = Immediate Life-Threatening Emergency**

- Sinking, fire, medical emergency, immediate danger
- Requires immediate assistance

**PAN-PAN = Urgent but Not Immediately Life-Threatening**

- Disabled, taking on water but stable, medical concern
- Needs assistance but not immediate danger

**SECURITE = Safety Information**

- Navigation hazards, weather warnings
- Information broadcast, not request for assistance

### VHF RADIO - MAYDAY PROCEDURE

**Channel 16 (156.8 MHz) - International Distress**

**Format:**

```
MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY
This is [vessel name] [vessel name] [vessel name]
MAYDAY [vessel name]
Position: [lat/long or bearing/distance from landmark]
Nature of distress: [sinking/fire/flooding/medical]

1. **Lift cover, press DSC distress button** (hold 3-5 seconds)
2. **Automatically transmits:**
   - Vessel ID (MMSI)
   - Position (if GPS connected)
   - Nature of distress
3. **Coast Guard receives alert immediately**
4. **Follow with voice MAYDAY** on Ch 16

**Setup requirement:** MMSI must be programmed before emergency

### EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon)

**406 MHz Satellite Emergency Beacon**

**Activation:**

- **Manual:** Remove from bracket, deploy (auto-activates)
- **Automatic:** Float-free if vessel sinks
- **Test:** Only during first 5 minutes of any hour

**How it works:**

1. Transmits to Cospas-Sarsat satellites
2. Includes GPS position (if equipped)
3. Alert relayed to national rescue coordination center
4. Coast Guard/SAR dispatched
5. Accuracy: 120 meters with GPS

**Bring EPIRB into life raft** (continues transmitting, aids rescue)

**Battery:** 48-hour minimum transmission, check expiration annually

### VISUAL DISTRESS SIGNALS

**Daytime:**

## 10. NAVIGATION RULES (COLREGS) - QUICK REFERENCE

### VESSEL HIERARCHY (Who Gives Way)

**From Most to Least Privileged:**

1. **Not Under Command (NUC)** / **Restricted Ability to Maneuver (RAM)**
2. **Vessel Constrained by Draft** (large ship in channel)
3. **Fishing Vessels** (nets/trawls deployed)
4. **Sailing Vessels**
5. **Power-Driven Vessels**

**Exception:** Overtaking vessel always gives way (regardless of type)

### SAILING VESSEL RIGHT OF WAY (Rule 12)

**Both sailing, risk of collision:**

| Situation | Who Gives Way |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Wind on different sides** | Port tack vessel gives way to starboard tack |
| **Both on same tack** | Windward vessel gives way to leeward |
| **Port tack sees windward vessel, can't determine tack** | Port tack gives way |

**Remember:** Starboard tack = privileged (unless windward)

### POWER VESSELS MEETING (Rules 14-15)

**Head-On (Rule 14):**

- Both vessels alter course to **starboard** (pass port-to-port)
- If in doubt, assume head-on

**Crossing (Rule 15):**

- Vessel with other on **starboard side** gives way
- Stand-on vessel maintains course and speed
- Give-way vessel makes **obvious alteration** (pass astern)

**Overtaking (Rule 13):**

- Overtaking vessel keeps clear
- Passing within 22.5 deg of stern = overtaking
- Overtaking remains give-way even if crossing later

### SOUND SIGNALS IN RESTRICTED VISIBILITY

**Power vessel making way:**

- 1 long blast every 2 minutes

**Power vessel stopped:**

- 2 long blasts every 2 minutes

**Sailing vessel, fishing, NUC, RAM:**

- 1 long + 2 short blasts every 2 minutes

**Anchored (if required):**

- Rapid bell ringing for 5 seconds every minute
- Large vessels: Bell forward, gong aft

### LIGHTS (Memory Aid)

**Port = Red = Left**
**Starboard = Green = Right**
**Stern = White = Behind**

**Power vessel underway:**

- Red (port) + Green (starboard) + White masthead forward + White stern

**Sailing vessel:**

- Red (port) + Green (starboard) + White stern
- Optional: Red over green at masthead (sailing)

**At anchor:**

- All-round white (forward, plus stern if >50m)

### NARROW CHANNELS (Rule 9)

- Keep to **starboard side** of channel
- Small vessels and sailing vessels: **Don't impede** large vessels confined to channel
- Don't cross channel if impedes vessel that can only navigate in channel
- Don't anchor in channel (unless emergency)

---

## 11. SECURITY THREAT RESPONSE

### THREAT ASSESSMENT LEVELS

**GREEN (Routine):**

- No specific threats
- Maintain normal watchkeeping
- Update intel before entering new regions

**YELLOW (Elevated):**

- Area with known piracy/security risks
- Enhanced watchkeeping, security measures
- Avoid patterns, maintain communications

**ORANGE (High Risk):**

- Recent attacks in area
- Implement all security measures
- Consider armed escort or convoy
- Report transit plans to authorities

**RED (Imminent Threat):**

- Attack in progress or immediate
- Evasive action, distress call
- All crew to safe haven

### PIRACY HIGH-RISK AREAS (Current)

**Avoid or extreme caution:**

- Gulf of Aden / Somali waters (750+ nm offshore)
- Yemeni coast
- South China Sea / Straits of Malacca
- Gulf of Guinea (West Africa)
- Certain Caribbean anchorages

**Check:** Current piracy reports before entering region (MSCHOA, ICC-IMB)

### PREVENTIVE SECURITY MEASURES

**Passive Defenses:**

-  Bright deck lighting (all-round visibility)
-  Barbed wire on stanchions (prevents boarding)
-  Bridge/companionway lockable from inside
-  Remove external boarding aids (ladders, swim platforms)
-  Water hoses ready for spray deterrent
-  Alarm system (loud hailer, fog horn, strobe lights)

**Watch Protocols:**

-  24-hour watch in high-risk areas
-  Radar on continuous (detect approaching vessels)
-  AIS transmit OFF in piracy zones (reduces targeting)
-  Monitor VHF Ch 16 (distress calls, warnings)
-  Report to regional security centers

**Navigation:**

-  Stay offshore >100 nm (out of small boat range)
-  Avoid anchoring isolated areas
-  Transit high-risk areas quickly (no loitering)
-  Vary course/speed (unpredictable)
-  Night passages in high-risk zones (harder to spot)

### IF APPROACHED BY SUSPICIOUS VESSEL

**Early Response (>1 nm):**

1. **Activate alarm** (crew to stations)
2. **Change course/speed** (test if following)
3. **Call on VHF Ch 16** ("Vessel approaching [your position], identify yourself")
4. **Increase speed** if able (outrun)
5. **Alter course toward traffic** (seek other vessels)
6. **Broadcast PAN-PAN** (alert nearby vessels/authorities)

**Imminent Threat (<0.5 nm, clearly hostile):**

1. **MAYDAY on VHF Ch 16** ("Under piracy attack at [position]")
2. **Activate EPIRB** (summons rescue)
3. **Crew to safe haven** (locked interior cabin/safe room)
4. **Employ active defenses:**
   - Fire hoses (high-pressure spray)
   - Loud hailers/fog horn (disorient)
   - Strobe lights (night, disorient)
   - Flares aimed at attackers
   - Evasive maneuvering (hard turns, speed)

### IF BOARDED

**Crew Safety Priority:**

- **Do not resist** (life over property)
- **Comply with demands** (reduce violence)
- **Stay calm, speak slowly**
- **Separate children/women if possible** (less traumatic)
- **Note details** (number, descriptions, weapons, language)
- **Signal duress if able** (VHF "all is well" = code for distress)

**Post-Incident:**

- Report immediately to authorities
- Medical evaluation for all crew
- Document everything (while memory fresh)
- Psychological support (trauma counseling)

## 12. RATIONING PROTOCOLS

### WHEN TO IMPLEMENT RATIONING

**Triggers:**

- Supplies below 50% with no resupply option
- Passage duration exceeds planned by 25%+
- Emergency situation (life raft, dismasted, long-term survival)
- Water shortage or contamination

**Start rationing BEFORE desperation** (easier to extend than survive shortage)

### WATER RATIONING

#### Human Water Needs by Temperature

| Air Temp | Minimal Survival | Subsistence | Working |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| 50 degF (10 degC) | 1.5 L/day | 2.5 L/day | 4 L/day |
| 70 degF (20 degC) | 2 L/day | 3 L/day | 5 L/day |
| 90 degF (30 degC) | 3 L/day | 4 L/day | 7+ L/day |

**Children:** Reduce by 25-50% depending on age/size

#### Emergency Water Ration Schedule

**Level 1 (Standard):** 3 liters/person/day

- Drinking, basic hygiene, cooking
- Can sustain indefinitely in moderate climate

**Level 2 (Conservation):** 2 liters/person/day

- Drinking and essential cooking only
- No washing (salt water for dishes)
- Sustainable weeks to months

**Level 3 (Survival):** 1 liter/person/day

- Drinking only, minimal cooking
- Dehydration symptoms likely
- Sustainable 1-2 weeks maximum

**Level 4 (Emergency):** 0.5 liter/person/day

- Life raft survival
- Severe dehydration expected
- Maximum 7-10 days survival

#### Water Ration Distribution

**Method:**

- Distribute in **morning and evening** (2 portions)
- Use **marked containers** (no guessing)
- **Elder/captain supervises** (prevent cheating)
- **Equal portions** (morale critical)
- **Children drink full share** (higher need per pound)

**DO NOT:**

- Drink seawater (accelerates dehydration, causes death)
- Drink urine (concentrates toxins)
- Drink alcohol (dehydrates)
- Ration below 0.5 L/day (body begins to fail)

### FOOD RATIONING

#### Caloric Needs

| Activity Level | Calories/Day | Scenario |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Resting (survival)** | 1200-1500 | Life raft, minimal movement |
| **Light activity** | 1500-2000 | Motoring, calm passage |
| **Moderate work** | 2000-2500 | Active sailing, watch duties |
| **Heavy work** | 2500-3500 | Storm conditions, repairs |

**Children:** Reduce by 25% (ages 6-12) or 50% (under 6)

#### Food Ration Levels

**Level 1 (Standard):** 2500 cal/person/day

- 3 meals + snacks
- Normal cruising, no shortage

**Level 2 (Conservation):** 1800 cal/person/day

- 2 meals + light snack
- Extend supplies 30-40%
- Sustainable long-term

**Level 3 (Survival):** 1200 cal/person/day

- 1 meal + small ration
- Extend supplies 100%+
- Weight loss, fatigue expected

**Level 4 (Emergency):** 600-800 cal/person/day

- Minimal intake
- Life raft survival
- Muscle wasting, severe weakness

#### Ration Priorities

**Consume first (spoils quickly):**

- Fresh produce
- Dairy, eggs
- Meat (unless canned)

**Consume mid-term:**

- Canned goods (check dates)
- Frozen foods (if power available)

**Conserve longest (last resort):**

- Rice, pasta, grains
- Dried beans, lentils
- Emergency rations (energy bars)
- Fishing provisions

### RATIONING PSYCHOLOGY

**Keys to Success:**

- **Start early** (before people desperate)
- **Be transparent** (show inventory, explain plan)
- **Equal portions** (perception of fairness critical)
- **Structured meals** (maintains routine, morale)
- **Assign tasks** (keeps minds occupied)
- **Celebrate small wins** (ration extended, landfall nearing)

**Children:**

- Maintain structure (meal times consistent)
- Involve in process (counting, distributing)
- Don't discuss fear/scarcity (shield from panic)
- Ensure they get full ration (growth, higher metabolic needs)

-  Acknowledge fear ("Scared is okay; we've practiced this")

**After Emergency:**

-  Debrief together (what happened, what we did)
-  Normalize emotions (validate feelings)
-  Celebrate success ("You did great when...")
-  Adjust training (what worked, what didn't)
-  Professional help if trauma symptoms (nightmares, withdrawal, regression)

## FINAL REMINDERS

**In any emergency:**

1. **Stay calm** - Panic kills more than the emergency itself
2. **Assess quickly** - What is the problem? How serious?
3. **Act decisively** - Hesitation wastes critical time
4. **Communicate** - Crew coordination and outside help
5. **Adapt** - Plans change; be flexible
6. **Never give up** - Survival stories are written by those who persisted

**Training beats equipment every time.**

Drill these procedures regularly. When the emergency happens, you'll fall to your level of trainingmake that level high.
