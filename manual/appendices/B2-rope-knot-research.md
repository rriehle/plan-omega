- Moderate cost
- Primary use: Traditional applications, landscaping, where grip important

### 2. Breaking Strength - Critical Data Points

**Common Rope Sizes (Breaking Strength in lbs):**

3/8" Diameter Comparison:
- Nylon 3-strand: 3,340 lbs
- Polyester double braid: 4,800 lbs
- Polypropylene: 2,440 lbs
- Manila: 1,200 lbs

1/2" Diameter Comparison:
- Nylon 3-strand: 5,750 lbs
- Polyester double braid: 8,300 lbs
- Polypropylene: 4,320 lbs
- Manila: 2,650 lbs

5/8" Diameter Comparison:
- Nylon 3-strand: 9,350 lbs
- Polyester double braid: 13,000 lbs
- Polypropylene: 6,800 lbs
- Manila: 4,400 lbs

**Key Insight:** Polyester consistently provides 40-50% higher breaking strength than nylon at the same diameter.

### 3. Working Load Limits - Safety Critical

**Industry Standard Safety Factors:**
- General marine use: 5:1 (Working Load = Breaking Strength ÷ 5)
- Life safety applications: 10:1
- Critical lifting/rigging: 12:1
- Shock loading expected: 15:1

**The Cordage Institute Recommendation:**
Default safety factor for synthetic rope is 10% of manufacturer's documented Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS), equivalent to 10:1 ratio.

**Critical Reality Check:**
A 1/2" nylon rope with 5,750 lbs breaking strength has:
- Working Load (5:1): 1,150 lbs
- Working Load (10:1): 575 lbs

Always use higher safety factors (10:1) for:
- Life safety situations
- Unknown rope age/condition
- Shock loading potential
- Severe weather conditions

### 4. Knot Efficiency - The Strength Penalty

**Major Finding:** All knots significantly reduce rope strength.

**General Rule:** Expect 40-50% strength loss with any knot.

**Specific Knot Efficiencies:**
- Eye Splice: 90-95% (BEST - always splice when possible)
- Figure 8 Loop: 75-80%
- Alpine Butterfly: 70-75%
- Bowline: 70-75%
- Double Fisherman's: 65-70%
- Clove Hitch: 60-65%
- Round Turn & 2 Half Hitches: 60%
- Sheet Bend: 40-45% (POOR)
- Square Knot: 40-45% (POOR - dangerous under load)

**Critical Safety Recommendation:**
When calculating working loads, use 50% efficiency for any knot to provide adequate safety margin.

**Why Splices Are Superior:**
- Splices retain 90-95% vs. 40-75% for knots
- No sharp bends creating stress concentration
- Load distributed across more rope structure
- Always use splices for permanent applications

### 5. Rope Stretch - Application Critical

**High Stretch Materials (Dynamic Loading):**
- Nylon: 15-28% at break, 10-15% at working load
- Use for: Anchor rode, dock lines, towing
- Benefit: Absorbs shock loads, cushions impact

**Low Stretch Materials (Static Loading):**
- Dyneema: 3.5% at break, 1-2% at working load
- Polyester: 2.6-10% at break, 2-4% at working load
- Use for: Halyards, sheets, control lines
- Benefit: Precise sail trim, better control

**Practical Implication:**
Wrong material choice significantly impacts performance:
- High stretch on halyards = sloppy sail shape
- Low stretch on anchor rode = shock loads on hardware

### 6. UV Resistance - Longevity Factor

**Ranked Best to Worst:**

1. **Polyester - Excellent** (5-10 year lifespan outdoors)
2. **Dyneema/HMPE - Excellent** (5-10 year lifespan)
3. **Nylon - Good** (3-5 year lifespan, will fade)
4. **Manila - Fair** (2-3 years, natural degradation)
5. **Polypropylene - POOR** (6 months-2 years, becomes brittle)

**Critical Warning: Polypropylene**
- Loses up to 70% strength in just 6 days continuous UV exposure
- UV-treated versions perform better (up to 10 years)
- Still poorest choice for permanent outdoor use
- Reserve for temporary applications or where floatation required

**UV Protection Strategies:**
- Use polyester for permanent installations
- Use rope covers on furled sails
- Store unused rope in dark, dry location
- Rotate rope end-for-end to distribute wear
- Inspect for powdery surface (UV damage indicator)

### 7. Anchor Rode Specifications

**Rule of Thumb Calculations:**
- Rope diameter: 1/8" per 9 feet of boat length
- Chain length: 1 foot per 1 foot of boat length (20 ft minimum)
- Chain size: half the rope diameter (1/2" rope = 1/4" chain)
- Total rode: minimum 300 ft for cruising boats

**Example for 30-foot boat:**
- Nylon rope: 1/2" diameter (5,750 lbs breaking strength)
- Chain: 30 ft of 1/4" BBB or high-test
- Total rode: 200-250 ft minimum
- Material: Nylon 3-strand for elasticity and shock absorption

**Scope Requirements (Critical for Holding Power):**
- 3:1 - Emergency only (40% holding power)
- 5:1 - Calm conditions, temporary (70% holding power)
- 7:1 - Standard anchoring (100% design holding power)
- 10:1 - Storm conditions (125% holding power)

**Scope Calculation Example:**
For 20 ft water depth + 5 ft bow freeboard = 25 ft total:
- 7:1 scope: 25 × 7 = 175 ft rode needed
- 10:1 scope: 25 × 10 = 250 ft rode needed

### 8. Essential Knots - When to Use What

**LOOPS (Creating fixed or adjustable loops):**
- **Bowline** (70-75%): Fixed loop, attach sheets to sails - most versatile
- **Figure 8 Loop** (75-80%): Stopper, prevent line running through blocks
- **Alpine Butterfly** (70-75%): Mid-line loop, can take load from three directions

**HITCHES (Attaching to object or another rope):**
- **Clove Hitch** (60-65%): Quick temporary mooring, fender lines
- **Round Turn & 2 Half Hitches** (60%): Permanent mooring to ring/post
- **Rolling Hitch** (60%): Attach to loaded line, take strain off jammed winch
- **Anchor Bend** (65-70%): Secure rode to anchor ring

**BENDS (Joining two ropes):**
- **Sheet Bend** (40-45%): Join unequal diameter ropes
- **Double Fisherman's** (65-70%): Permanent joining, very secure but hard to untie

**STOPPERS (Preventing rope from running):**
- **Figure 8 Stopper** (75-80%): Standard stopper, easy to tie and inspect
- **Admiralty Stopper**: More reliable than figure 8, won't jam as easily

**Top 5 Must-Know Knots:**
1. Bowline - Most versatile loop
2. Figure 8 - Best stopper
3. Clove Hitch - Quick temporary attachment
4. Round Turn & 2 Half Hitches - Secure mooring
5. Sheet Bend - Join two ropes

### 9. Rope Selection Decision Framework

**Ask These Questions in Order:**

1. **What's the primary requirement?**
   - Shock absorption → Nylon
   - Minimal stretch → Polyester or Dyneema
   - Must float → Polypropylene
   - Budget constrained → Polypropylene or Manila
   - Maximum UV resistance → Polyester
   - Traditional grip → Manila

2. **What's the expected load?**
   - Calculate: Required Working Load × Safety Factor = Minimum Breaking Strength
   - Select rope diameter that meets or exceeds this strength
   - Account for knot efficiency (reduce strength by 50%)

3. **What's the environment?**
   - Permanent outdoor → Polyester (best UV)
   - Temporary → Polypropylene acceptable
   - Wet environment → Polyester (maintains strength) or Polypropylene (floats)
   - Dry storage available → Nylon acceptable

4. **What's the application?**
   - Anchor rode → Nylon 3-strand (elasticity critical)
   - Running rigging → Polyester double braid (low stretch)
   - Dock lines → Nylon 3-strand (shock absorption)
   - Safety/rescue → Polypropylene (floatation) or Dyneema (strength)

### 10. Rope Retirement Criteria

**Replace Rope Immediately If:**
- Broken or frayed strands (>10% of fibers)
- Powdery residue on surface (UV damage)
- Glazed or melted appearance (heat damage)
- Inconsistent diameter or soft/hard spots (internal damage)
- Chemical contamination evident
- Been shock loaded beyond working load

**Age-Based Replacement Guidelines:**
- Critical safety applications: 5 years maximum
- General marine use: 10 years maximum with good care
- Anchor rode: Inspect annually, replace at first damage sign
- Running rigging (heavy use): 3-5 years typical

**Inspection Schedule:**
- Before/after every passage: Visual inspection
- Quarterly: Detailed inspection of high-load areas
- Annually: Complete inventory and condition assessment
- After storm/heavy weather: Immediate inspection

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Using Wrong Material for Application
**Problem:** Polyester anchor rode (no stretch = shock loads) or nylon halyards (too much stretch = poor sail shape)
**Solution:** Match material to application - nylon for dynamic, polyester for static

### Mistake 2: Insufficient Safety Factor
**Problem:** Using 5:1 safety factor for life safety or unknown rope condition
**Solution:** Always use 10:1 for life safety, older rope, or harsh conditions

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Knot Efficiency
**Problem:** Calculating working loads based on rope breaking strength without accounting for 40-50% knot reduction
**Solution:** Always reduce working load by 50% minimum when using knots vs. splices

### Mistake 4: Using Polypropylene for Permanent Applications
**Problem:** Polypropylene degrades rapidly in UV (70% loss in 6 days)
**Solution:** Use polypropylene only for temporary applications or where floatation required; use polyester for permanent

### Mistake 5: Insufficient Anchor Scope
**Problem:** Using 5:1 scope reduces holding power to 70% of design capacity
**Solution:** Use 7:1 minimum, 10:1 in storms or questionable holding

### Mistake 6: Square Knot Under Load
**Problem:** Square knot (reef knot) only 40-45% efficient and can slip under load
**Solution:** Never use square knot for critical loads; use bowline or splice

### Mistake 7: Not Accounting for Wet Strength Loss
**Problem:** Nylon loses 10-15% strength when wet
**Solution:** Size nylon rope assuming wet strength, or use polyester which maintains strength

### Mistake 8: Ignoring Rope Age
**Problem:** Rope deteriorates with time even if it looks good
**Solution:** Replace on schedule regardless of appearance for safety-critical applications

## Trade-Offs and Decision Context
