## Usage Notes

### Purpose and Importance

Thorough destination research is critical for:

- Safe navigation and anchoring
- Understanding local conditions and requirements
- Assessing suitability for various scenarios
- Planning provisioning and maintenance
- Building network of contacts and resources

### Research Timing

**Before Departure:**
Research all potential destinations along route and alternatives. Helps with route planning and contingency preparation.

**Annual Review:**
Update information for known destinations, especially:

- Political changes
- New services or closures
- Updated charts/guides
- Recent cruiser reports

**Before Arrival:**
Final check for recent changes, current conditions, entry requirements.

### Information Sources

**Primary Sources:**

- Current cruising guides (Noonsite, etc.)
- Official government websites
- Recent cruiser reports (blogs, forums)
- Pilot charts and sailing directions
- Charts (paper and electronic)

**Secondary Sources:**

- Older cruising guides (verify currency)
- Travel guides (non-marine perspective useful)
- Local tourism websites
- Social media groups
- Cruising networks

**Direct Sources:**

- VHF contact with boats in anchorage
- Email cruisers who visited recently
- Port authorities
- Marinas and service providers

### Navigation Assessment

Pay special attention to:

- **Approach hazards:** Reefs, rocks, shoals, currents
- **Entrance conditions:** Depth, width, marking
- **Anchorage quality:** Holding, depth, swing room, protection
- **Weather windows:** When safe to enter/exit
- **Local knowledge:** Talk to those who've been there

### Political and Legal Research

Critical for avoiding:

- Visa violations and fines
- Confiscation of firearms or restricted items
- Unexpected fees or bribes
- Areas of political instability
- Restrictions on movement

Research current:

- Entry requirements and processes
- Visa costs and duration
- Customs regulations
- Clearance procedures
- Known issues with officials

### Resource Evaluation

For potential long-term stays, assess:

- **Water:** Availability, quality, cost, backup sources
- **Food:** Markets, variety, cost, ability to fish/grow
- **Fuel:** Availability, quality, cost
- **Medical:** Level of care available, evacuation options
- **Parts/Repairs:** Can vessel be maintained here?

### Security Assessment

Honest evaluation of:

- Crime levels and types
- Recent incidents (especially against cruisers)
- Police/official reliability
- Need for enhanced security measures
- Safe areas vs. areas to avoid

Cross-reference multiple sources - don't rely on single reports.

### Scenario-Specific Evaluation

For each major scenario, consider:

**Economic Collapse:**

- Self-sufficiency potential
- Distance from urban chaos
- Local food/water security
- Barter economy viability

**Civil Unrest:**

- Political stability
- Distance from conflict zones
- Ease of rapid departure
- Local attitude to foreigners

**Climate Collapse:**

- Long-term habitability
- Food/water sustainability
- Cyclone/storm exposure
- Sea level rise vulnerability

**War Refuge:**

- Neutrality of nation
- Strategic importance
- Military presence/targets
- History of conflict

### Pros and Cons Analysis

Be honest about:

- Deal-breakers (unsafe, too expensive, etc.)
- Nice-to-haves vs. must-haves
- Trade-offs (e.g., remote but expensive to reach)
- Overall fit for your situation and plans

### Building Contact Network

Document:

- Port officials and procedures
- Service providers and quality
- Other cruisers and their knowledge
- Local contacts (especially helpful locals)
- Emergency contacts

### Information Currency

Destinations change. Note:

- When information was gathered
- When sources were published
- Known changes since last visit
- Need for updates before arrival

Plan to verify critical information (especially entry requirements, fees, services) close to arrival.

### Creating Destination Database

Maintain dossiers for:

- All planned destinations
- Alternate destinations along route
- Emergency refuges
- Potential long-term bases

Organize by:

- Geographic region
- Distance from current position
- Scenario suitability
- Season/weather window

### Sharing Information

Cruising community thrives on shared knowledge:

- Update others on changes you observe
- Contribute to online resources
- Share contact information
- Leave notes for cruisers following

### Integration with Planning

Use destination research for:

- Route planning (optimize for good destinations)
- Provisioning (know what's available where)
- Budgeting (cost expectations)
- Scheduling (seasonal considerations)
- Contingency planning (safe refuges identified)

### Red Flags

Be wary of destinations with:

- Consistently negative recent reports
- Political instability or recent coups
- Very high crime against cruisers
- Extremely difficult/dangerous approaches
- Corrupt officials demanding large bribes
- Recent piracy incidents
- Poor communication (can't call for help)

### Site Visit

Nothing beats actually visiting. When there:

- Verify your research
- Update dossier with observations
- Take photos (entrance, anchorage, facilities)
- Collect local knowledge
- Meet officials and service providers
- Document costs and procedures
- Share updated information with community
