## Usage Notes

### Purpose and Importance

Thorough passage planning is essential for:

- Safe navigation and hazard avoidance
- Crew preparation and confidence
- Resource management (fuel, water, food)
- Weather window selection
- Emergency preparedness
- Legal compliance

### Planning Timeline

**Weeks Before:**

- Route research and selection
- Weather pattern study
- Crew selection and briefing
- Major provisioning

**Days Before:**

- Weather window identification
- Final vessel preparation
- Detailed checklist completion
- Float plan filing

**Day Before:**

- Final weather check
- Last-minute provisioning
- Crew briefing
- Departure decision

### Route Planning

**Great Circle:**

- Shortest distance between two points
- Not straight line on Mercator chart
- May cross higher latitudes
- Consider weather and currents

**Rhumb Line:**

- Constant compass bearing
- Longer distance than great circle
- Easier to navigate
- Good for shorter passages

**Waypoint Route:**

- Avoids hazards and shipping lanes
- Follows favorable currents
- Optimizes weather routing
- Most common for cruisers

### Waypoint Planning

Include waypoints for:

- Course changes
- Hazard avoidance
- Shipping lane crossings
- Current optimization
- Destination approach

Document for each:

- Exact position (verify datum)
- Description/purpose
- Distance from previous WP
- Bearing to next WP
- Hazards or notes

### Weather Window Assessment

**Critical Factors:**

- Wind speed and direction
- Sea state and swell
- Tropical cyclone activity
- Frontal systems
- Fog likelihood

**Sources:**

- GRIB files (Windy, PredictWind, etc.)
- Official forecasts (NOAA, etc.)
- Pilot charts (historical patterns)
- SSB/Ham weather nets
- Satellite communications

**Decision Criteria:**

- Maximum acceptable wind
- Safe sea state for vessel/crew
- Favorable or acceptable wind angles
- Duration of window vs. passage time
- Escape options if conditions change

### Provisioning Calculations

**Water:**

- 1 gallon/person/day minimum
- 2 gallons/person/day comfortable
- Add 50% safety margin
- Consider watermaker reliability

**Fuel:**

- Calculate hours of motoring needed
- Account for charging batteries
- Add 30% safety margin
- Consider weather routing impact

**Food:**

- Plan for passage time + 50%
- High-calorie, easy to prepare
- Minimize cooking in rough weather
- Special needs (children, dietary)
- Emergency rations separate

### Vessel Preparation

**Priority Order:**

1. Safety equipment (life raft, EPIRB, etc.)
2. Navigation equipment (GPS, charts, etc.)
3. Communication equipment
4. Propulsion (engine, sails, rigging)
5. Below-deck security
6. Comfort items

**Common Oversights:**

- Securing books and loose items
- Testing autopilot under load
- Backup navigation equipment
- Medical kit completeness
- Spare parts for critical systems

### Watch System Design

**3-Hour Watches:**

- Good for short-handed crews
- Prevents excessive fatigue
- Rotates through schedule
- May disrupt sleep patterns

**4-Hour Watches:**

- Standard maritime practice
- Good balance of duty/rest
- Works well with 3-4 crew
- Dog watches prevent same schedule

**6-Hour Watches:**

- Good for 2-person crews
- Allows better sleep cycles
- Requires experienced, capable crew
- May be too long in rough weather

**Swedish Watch:**

- 3-person system
- 4 hours on, 8 hours off
- Excellent rest patterns
- Same time every day

### Communication Planning

**Check-in Schedule:**

- Daily minimum for offshore passages
- Specify exact time and method
- Include shore contact procedures
- Plan for missed check-ins

**Emergency Communications:**

- Primary: VHF (coastal)
- Secondary: SSB or Sat phone
- Emergency: EPIRB/PLB
- Test all before departure

### Contingency Planning

**Weather Contingencies:**

- Identify safe havens along route
- Know distance to each refuge
- Have charts and entry info ready
- Brief crew on diversion procedures

**Equipment Failure:**

- Critical: steering, engine, navigation
- Have backup or workaround planned
- Carry spares for critical items
- Know repair procedures

**Medical Emergency:**

- Telemedicine contact information
- Nearest ports with medical facilities
- Evacuation procedures
- Decision criteria for diversion

**Crew Issues:**

- MOB procedures reviewed
- Injury management
- Severe seasickness
- Conflict resolution

### Documentation Requirements

**Always Needed:**

- Ship's papers/documentation
- Passports for all crew
- Insurance papers
- Radio licenses

**Often Needed:**

- Visas (research in advance)
- Crew list
- Vaccination records
- Clearance papers (zarpe)

**Sometimes Needed:**

- Firearms declaration
- Pet documentation

- Underestimate passage

### Arrival Planning

**Before Entry:**

- Review entry requirements
- Check latest fees/procedures
- Prepare documentation
- Brief crew on customs process

**Entry Procedures:**

- Fly quarantine flag (yellow)
- Contact port on VHF
- No crew ashore until cleared
- Have documents ready
- Be patient and respectful

### Post-Passage Review

- Identify improvements needed
- Update procedures
- Share lessons learned

### Integration with Other Systems

**Link to:**

- Destination dossiers (ports along route)

- Maintenance schedule (pre-departure work)
- Threat assessment (route selection)
- Medical records (crew fitness)

### Special Considerations

**First Passage:**

- Start with shorter distance
- Choose favorable season
- Conservative weather window
- Extra safety margins
