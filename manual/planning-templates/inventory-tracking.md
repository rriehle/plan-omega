## Usage Guidelines

### Categories

Create separate tracking sheets for each major category:

- **Food:** Dry goods, canned goods, fresh provisions
- **Water:** Drinking water, tank levels, purification supplies
- **Medical:** Medications, first aid supplies, prescription drugs
- **Fuel:** Diesel, gasoline, propane, oil
- **Parts:** Engine parts, rigging hardware, electrical components
- **Other:** Cleaning supplies, batteries, personal items

### Tracking Best Practices

1. **Location Codes:** Develop consistent location coding system
   - Example: "P1" = Port locker 1, "ER" = Engine room

2. **Unit Consistency:** Use standard units throughout
   - Weight: kg or lbs (pick one)
   - Volume: liters or gallons (pick one)
   - Count: each, dozen, case

3. **Minimum Stock Levels:** Set based on:
   - Consumption rate
   - Resupply availability
   - Storage capacity
   - Criticality of item

### Consumption Analysis

Track consumption to:

- Predict future needs
- Identify unusual usage patterns
- Plan resupply timing
- Budget for replacements

Calculate daily rate: (Start Qty - End Qty) / Days in Period

### Expiration Management

**90-Day Review:** Items expiring within 90 days require action plans
**Action Options:**

- Use: Prioritize in meal planning or maintenance
- Replace: Order replacement before expiration
- Discard: Properly dispose of expired items

### Integration with Other Systems

- Link to meal planning for food inventory
- Connect to maintenance schedule for parts tracking
- Reference in passage planning for provisioning needs
- Use in drill scenarios for emergency supplies

### Digital Backup

Consider using spreadsheet software for:

- Automatic calculations
- Sorting and filtering
- Historical trend analysis
- Easy updating and sharing
