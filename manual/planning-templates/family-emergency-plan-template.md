## Usage Guidelines

### Plan Development Process

1. **Initial Planning Session:**
   - Involve all family members age-appropriately
   - Discuss realistic scenarios without causing panic
   - Assign roles based on capabilities
   - Set clear expectations

2. **Scenario Prioritization:**
   - Identify most likely scenarios for your location
   - Develop detailed plans for top 3 scenarios
   - Create general framework for others

3. **Role Assignment Principles:**
   - Match tasks to abilities
   - Provide backup for every critical role
   - Give everyone meaningful responsibilities
   - Consider physical and emotional capabilities

### Communication Protocols

**Internal Communications:**

- Establish clear code words that won't alarm others
- Practice using backup communication methods
- Set regular check-in times during separations
- Create communication cascade (who contacts whom)

**External Communications:**

- Designate single point of contact for extended family
- Establish "I'm okay" check-in system
- Plan for communication blackouts
- Include international calling codes

### Children and Emergency Planning

**Age-Appropriate Involvement:**

- Ages 3-6: Basic safety concepts, staying with adults
- Ages 7-11: Rally points, emergency contacts, simple tasks

- Ages 18+: Full participation in planning and execution

**Reducing Anxiety:**

- Frame as "adventure planning"
- Focus on preparation as empowerment
- Practice through games and activities
- Celebrate successful drills

### Evacuation Decision Matrix

| Threat Level | Time Available | Action |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Immediate | < 1 hour | Go-bags only, primary route |
| Urgent | 1-6 hours | Planned supplies, check routes |
| Planned | 6-24 hours | Full preparation, optimal timing |
| Precautionary | > 24 hours | Staged departure, monitor situation |

### Document Security
