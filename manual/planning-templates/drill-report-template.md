## Usage Notes

### Purpose and Importance

Regular drills are essential for:

- Emergency preparedness
- Crew training and confidence
- Equipment readiness verification
- Identifying gaps in procedures
- Building muscle memory for critical responses

### Drill Frequency Recommendations

**Monthly Minimum:**

- Man Overboard
- Fire (alternating locations)
- One additional scenario

**Quarterly:**

- Abandon Ship
- Medical Emergency
- Storm Preparation

**Situational:**

- New crew members
- Before challenging passages
- After equipment changes
- Following actual incidents

### Conducting Effective Drills

**Planning:**

1. Select scenario relevant to current conditions
2. Define clear objectives
3. Brief crew on scenario (or conduct surprise drill)
4. Ensure safety observers if needed

**Execution:**

1. Announce drill clearly (or use alarm)
2. Time from announcement to completion
3. Observe without interfering unless safety issue
4. Note specific actions and timing

**Debriefing:**

1. Immediate hot debrief after drill
2. Encourage honest feedback
3. Discuss what went well and what didn't
4. Complete written report within 24 hours

### Common Drill Types

**Man Overboard (MOB):**

- Quick response critical
- Different methods (Quick-Stop, Figure-8, etc.)
- Day vs. night scenarios
- Test all recovery methods

**Fire:**

- Location varies response (engine room, galley, cabin)
- Extinguisher access and operation
- Crew communication
- Shutdown procedures

**Flooding:**

- Source identification
- Pump operation
- Damage control
- Decision points for abandon ship

**Medical:**

- Assessment and stabilization
- Communication with shore medical
- Medication administration
- Evacuation decision-making

**Abandon Ship:**

- Life raft deployment
- Ditch bag preparation
- EPIRB activation
- Boarding procedures

**Storm Preparation:**

- Sail reduction/removal
- Deck securing
- Interior preparation
- Crew safety equipment

### Evaluation Criteria

**Excellent:** Exceeds standards, instinctive responses, no errors
**Good:** Meets standards, some hesitation, minor errors
**Adequate:** Completes task but needs improvement
**Poor:** Fails to complete safely or requires intervention

### Tracking Improvements

- Compare times across multiple drills of same type
- Track objective completion rates
- Monitor equipment readiness trends
- Note recurring issues for systemic fixes

### Action Item Follow-up

- Assign clear responsibility for each action
- Set realistic completion dates
- Review action items before next drill
- Close loop on completed items

### Special Considerations

**With Children:**

- Age-appropriate roles
- Focus on safety first
- Make it educational, not frightening
- Emphasize teamwork

**New Crew:**

- Extra training before drill
- Assign experienced mentor
- Start with simple scenarios
- Build complexity gradually

**Equipment Issues Found:**

- Document immediately
- Add to maintenance schedule
- Don't wait for next drill to fix
- Consider backup equipment

### Integration with Other Systems

- Link action items to maintenance schedule
- Reference in daily log
- Update emergency procedures if needed
- Track in training records

### Storage and Reference

- Keep reports in chronological order
- Create summary sheet tracking drill frequency
- Review before planning next drill
- Share with new crew during onboarding
