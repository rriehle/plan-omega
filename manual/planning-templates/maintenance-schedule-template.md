## Usage Notes

### Purpose and Importance

The Maintenance Schedule is essential for:

- Preventive maintenance tracking
- System reliability and safety
- Warranty compliance
- Resale value documentation
- Identifying recurring issues

### System-Specific Schedules

Create separate schedules for major systems:

- **Engine:** Track hours-based and calendar-based maintenance
- **Rigging:** Annual inspections, tension checks, replacements
- **Electrical:** Battery maintenance, connection inspections, solar panel cleaning
- **Plumbing:** Pump servicing, head maintenance, watermaker service
- **Sails:** Inspections, repairs, UV protection replacement
- **Safety Equipment:** Expiration dates, testing, certifications
- **Electronics:** Software updates, calibration, backup testing

### Interval Guidelines

**Daily (D):**

- Engine checks (oil, coolant, belts)
- Bilge inspection
- Battery voltage check

**Weekly (W):**

- Through-hull inspections
- Rigging spot checks
- Electronics backup

**Monthly (M):**

- Oil analysis
- Comprehensive system checks
- Safety equipment inspection

**Quarterly (Q):**

- Major system servicing
- Detailed rigging inspection
- Electronics calibration

**Semi-Annual (S):**

- Haul-out tasks
- Bottom paint inspection
- Through-hull servicing

**Annual (A):**

- Complete system overhaul
- Professional surveys
- Safety equipment certification

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Be Specific:** Record exact products used (oil type, part numbers)
2. **Track Costs:** Helps budget for future maintenance
3. **Note Conditions:** Weather, sea state during maintenance
4. **Photograph:** Before and after photos of major work
5. **Keep Receipts:** Attach or reference with dates

### Parts Inventory Management

Use the Parts Inventory section to:

- Track consumables (filters, oils, impellers)
- Plan provisioning for remote areas
- Identify critical spares to carry
- Budget for upcoming purchases

### Maintenance Priorities

**Urgent:** Safety-critical, immediate action required
**High:** Important for reliability, schedule within week
**Medium:** Important but can wait 2-4 weeks
**Low:** Cosmetic or nice-to-have improvements

### Storage and Reference

- Keep completed schedules in chronological order
- Cross-reference with receipts and manual sections
- Create summary sheets for quick reference
- Update vessel systems manual with modifications
- Share schedule with crew for awareness

### Integration with Other Systems

Link maintenance activities to:

- Daily log entries (record work performed)
- Inventory tracking (parts used)
- Budget planning (cost tracking)
- Passage planning (ensure systems ready)
