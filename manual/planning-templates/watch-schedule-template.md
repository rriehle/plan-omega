## Usage Notes

### Purpose and Importance

Organized watch schedules ensure:

- Continuous vigilance and safety
- Fair distribution of duties
- Adequate rest for all crew
- Clear accountability
- Smooth watch transitions
- Crew morale and harmony

### Watch System Selection

Choose based on:

- Number of crew
- Experience level
- Passage duration
- Weather conditions
- Crew preferences

### Common Watch Systems

**3-Hour Watches (8 watches/day):**

**Pros:**

- Prevents excessive fatigue
- Good for short-handed crews
- Rotates everyone through all times
- Easier to stay alert

**Cons:**

- Disrupts sleep cycles
- Many watch changes
- Hard to establish routine

**Best for:**

- 2-3 person crews
- Challenging conditions
- Less experienced crew

**4-Hour Watches (6 watches/day):**

**Pros:**

- Standard maritime practice
- Good balance duty/rest
- Allows watch routines to develop
- Works well with dog watches

**Cons:**

- Can be long in tough conditions
- Same crew gets same watches daily (without dog watches)

**Best for:**

- 3-4 person crews
- Moderate conditions
- Experienced crew

**Dog Watches:**
Traditional system uses "dog watches" 1600-1800 and 1800-2000 to rotate schedule. This prevents same crew standing same watch every day.

**6-Hour Watches (4 watches/day):**

**Pros:**

- Long rest periods (6 hours off)
- Allows deep sleep cycles
- Simple schedule
- Consistent times

**Cons:**

- Very long watches
- Requires experienced, capable crew
- May be too long in rough weather
- Difficult if seasick or fatigued

**Best for:**

- 2 person crews
- Good conditions
- Very experienced crew
- Short passages

**Swedish Watch (3-person):**

**Schedule:**

- Watch 1: 0000-0400, 1200-1600
- Watch 2: 0400-0800, 1600-2000
- Watch 3: 0800-1200, 2000-0000

**Pros:**

- 4 hours on, 8 hours off
- Excellent rest patterns
- Same times every day
- Most rested system

**Cons:**

- Requires exactly 3 capable crew
- Inflexible if someone ill

**Best for:**

- 3 person crews
- Long passages
- All experienced crew

### Watch Rotation

**Same Watch Daily:**

- Predictable routine
- Body adapts to schedule
- Can get monotonous
- Some times undesirable (0000-0400)

**Rotating Daily:**

- Shares "good" and "bad" watches
- More variety
- Harder to establish routine
- Need rotation plan

**Hybrid:**

- Rotate every 2-3 days
- Balance routine and fairness
- Allow schedule adaptation
- Prevent boredom

### Watch Duties

**Critical Responsibilities:**

1. **Lookout:** Most important job. Watch for:
   - Other vessels (collision risk)
   - Navigation hazards
   - Weather changes
   - Equipment issues
   - Anything unusual

2. **Course Monitoring:**
   - Check compass course regularly
   - Verify GPS track
   - Monitor autopilot/windvane
   - Adjust for currents/wind shifts

3. **Sail Management:**
   - Trim for efficiency
   - Reef if needed
   - Check for chafe
   - Monitor sail condition

4. **Weather Monitoring:**
   - Barometer changes
   - Wind shifts
   - Cloud development
   - Sea state changes

5. **Logging:**
   - Position hourly
   - Weather conditions
   - Course and speed
   - Sail configuration
   - Traffic sighted
   - Issues or concerns

### Watch Relief Procedures

**15 Minutes Before:**
Wake relief. Gives time to:

**Formal Relief:**

- Relief: "I relieve you"
- Going off watch: "I stand relieved"
- Both understand situation
- Log the change

### Night Watch Considerations

**Special Challenges:**

- Reduced visibility
- Fatigue (especially 0000-0400)
- Difficult to spot traffic
- Cold temperatures
- Isolation/boredom

**Safety Measures:**

- Always wear harness
- Use jacklines
- Red light only (preserve night vision)
- Stay warm and dry
- Don't hesitate to wake captain
- Extra coffee/snacks okay

**Radar/AIS:**
Essential at night. Set alarms for:

- Closest point of approach
- Traffic within range
- Course deviations

### Weather-Modified Schedules

**When to Modify:**

- Heavy weather
- Rough seas
- High traffic areas
- Challenging navigation
- Equipment issues

- Two-person watches
- All hands standby
- Captain on deck
- More frequent relief

**Return to Normal:**
When conditions improve and crew rested.

### Anchor Watch

- Weather concerns
- Tidal currents
- Busy harbors
- Official requirements

**Duties:**

- Check position every 30 min
- Monitor weather
- Watch other vessels

### Galley Schedule

**Integration with Watches:**

- Cook may be exempt during meal prep
- Or cooking is watch duty
- Depends on crew size and preferences

**Considerations:**

- Who's good at cooking?
- Seasickness affects ability
- Timing around watch changes
- Simple meals in rough weather
- Snacks for watch standers

### Daily Task Assignment

**Beyond Watch Duties:**

- Confusion or disorientation
- Irritability
- Poor decision making
- Falling asleep on watch
- Excessive seasickness

**Interventions:**

- Shorten watches

- Reduce other duties
- Consider diversion if serious

**Prevention:**

- Adequate off-watch rest
- Comfortable sleeping arrangements
- Minimize night interruptions
- Good nutrition

**Short-Handed (2 people):**

- Longer watches necessary (6 hours)
- Reliable autopilot essential
- Sleep when off watch
- Alarm for traffic/hazards
- Extra vigilance required
- Conservative weather routing

**Medical Issues:**

- Adjust schedule if crew member ill
- Others cover watches
- May need to suspend rotation
- Consider diversion if serious

### Watch Log Maintenance

**What to Record:**

- Time
- Position (GPS)
- Course made good
- Speed over ground
- Wind speed and direction
- Barometric pressure
- Sea state
- Sail configuration
- Traffic sighted
- Any events or issues

**Why It Matters:**

- Legal document
- Navigation tracking
- Weather pattern analysis
- Performance data
- Problem identification
- Stories to tell later

### Emergency Protocol

**When Emergency Declared:**

- Watch schedule suspended
- All hands on deck
- Captain assumes command
- Specific emergency roles
- Focus on situation

**After Emergency:**

- Resume watches when safe
- May need modified schedule
- Crew may be fatigued
- Allow recovery time

### Communication and Morale

**Good Watch Practices:**

- Hot coffee for relief
- Positive attitude
- Share interesting sights
- Maintain cleanliness
- Handle issues proactively

**Poor Practices to Avoid:**

- Loud noise during off-watch hours

- Not waking captain for major ones

### Integration with Other Planning

**Link to:**

- Passage planning (watch system design)
- Daily log (watch performance notes)
- Crew assignments (roles and responsibilities)
- Safety procedures (emergency stations)
- Galley schedule (meal planning)

### Post-Passage Review

**Evaluate:**

- Did watch system work well?

- Crew fatigue levels?
- Any schedule conflicts?
- Improvements for next passage?

**Document Lessons:**

- What worked
- What didn't
- Modifications made

### Sample Watch Schedule

**Day 1:**

- 0000-0400: Person A
- 0400-0800: Person B
- 0800-1200: Person C
- 1200-1600: Person D
- 1600-2000: Person A
- 2000-0000: Person B

**Day 2:** (Rotated)
