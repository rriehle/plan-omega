## Usage Notes

### Purpose and Importance

Regular threat assessment is critical for:

- Early warning of developing situations
- Informed decision-making on movements
- Crew situational awareness
- Resource allocation (provisions, fuel, routes)
- Maintaining operational readiness

### Assessment Frequency

**Weekly:** Under normal conditions (Level 1)
**Every 3-4 days:** Enhanced awareness (Level 2)
**Daily:** Activation conditions (Level 3)
**Continuous:** Survival conditions (Level 4)

**Trigger Events for Immediate Assessment:**

- Major news events affecting region
- Reports from other cruisers
- Government warnings or advisories
- Local incidents observed
- Significant changes in any indicator

### Threat Level Definitions

**Level 1 - Normal:**

- Business as usual
- Standard precautions
- Regular monitoring
- Normal operations

**Level 2 - Enhanced:**

- Concerning developments
- Increased monitoring
- Enhanced preparations
- Review contingency plans

**Level 3 - Activation:**

- Serious threat identified
- Execute departure preparations
- Daily assessment
- Communication with network

**Level 4 - Survival:**

- Immediate threat to safety
- Execute emergency plans
- Minimize exposure
- Constant reassessment

### Scenario-Specific Indicators

**Economic Collapse:**
Monitor financial news, local economic conditions, ability to access cash and supplies. Focus on whether basic needs can be met and if commerce is functioning.

**Civil Unrest:**
Track protest activity, government responses, rule of law stability. Pay attention to whether violence is spreading or isolated.

**Climate Collapse:**
Observe weather patterns, food availability, migration patterns. Consider longer-term habitability of current and planned locations.

**War/Conflict:**
Monitor diplomatic relations, military activities, rhetoric. Assess risk of being caught in conflict zone or denied access to safe areas.

**Local/Regional Threats:**
Specific to location - piracy, political instability, crime, natural disasters. These vary greatly by region and require local knowledge.

### Information Source Evaluation

**High Reliability:**

- Official government sources
- Established news organizations
- Direct observation
- Trusted local contacts

**Medium Reliability:**

- Cruiser networks
- Social media from verified sources
- Secondary news sources
- Marine radio reports

**Low Reliability:**

- Unverified social media
- Rumors
- Third-hand reports
- Outdated information

**Cross-Reference:** Always verify critical information with multiple sources before acting.

### Trend Analysis

Compare assessments over time to identify:

- Gradual deterioration requiring early action
- False alarms vs. persistent concerns
- Seasonal or cyclic patterns
- Your own assessment accuracy

### Recommended Actions

Link threat level to specific actions:

- What to do immediately
- Preparations for next 7 days
- Trigger points for departure
- Communication plan with family/network

### Readiness Status

Honestly assess how quickly you could depart:

- **1 hour:** Anchored, minimal gear ashore, crew aboard, ready to slip
- **6 hours:** Light provisioned, some gear to retrieve, crew available
- **24 hours:** Need provisioning, significant gear ashore, crew scattered
- **>24 hours:** Major work needed, repairs underway, crew away

**Goal:** In elevated threat areas, maintain 6-hour or better readiness.

### Crew Communication

Share threat assessments with entire crew:

- Everyone needs situational awareness
- Children need age-appropriate briefing
- Crew input may identify missed indicators
- Shared understanding supports quick decisions

Avoid:

- Creating panic with raw data
- Dismissing crew concerns
- Making unilateral decisions
- Ignoring local perspectives

### Documentation and History

Keep completed assessments to:

- Track your assessment accuracy
- Learn from false alarms
- Improve indicator selection
- Brief new crew or boats entering area

Review old assessments to:

- Calibrate threat perception
- Identify personal biases
- Improve methodology
- Share lessons learned

### Integration with Other Planning

**Link to:**

- Destination research (safe havens)
- Passage planning (escape routes)
- Provisioning (emergency supplies)
- Communications (check-in schedules)
- Daily log (situation tracking)

### Special Considerations

**Remote Areas:**
Information may be limited or delayed. Increase reliance on direct observation and fellow cruisers.

**Language Barriers:**
May miss local news and sentiment. Find translators or English-language sources. Observe body language and behavior.

**Children Aboard:**
Balance awareness with not creating excessive fear. Use age-appropriate explanations and emphasize your preparations.

**Multiple Threats:**
May need to weigh competing risks (e.g., economic instability ashore vs. cyclone season). Prioritize immediate physical safety.

### False Alarms and Complacency

**False Alarms:** Better to over-prepare than be caught unprepared. Learn from false alarms but don't stop assessing.

**Complacency:** Most dangerous after long periods of calm. Maintain discipline in assessment schedule.
