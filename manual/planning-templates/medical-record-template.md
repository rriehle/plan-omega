Be specific about:

- What hurts/is wrong
- How long it's been happening
- What makes it better/worse

### History of Present Illness

Critical information for diagnosis:

- **Onset:** Sudden vs. gradual helps narrow causes
- **Duration:** How long has this been going on?
- **Progression:** Getting better, worse, or same?
- **Similar episodes:** Pattern of recurring issues?
- **Context:** What was happening when it started?

### Physical Examination

**General Appearance:**
How does patient look overall? Alert? In pain? Comfortable?

**HEENT (Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat):**

- Pupils equal and reactive?
- Ears clear?
- Throat red or swollen?

**Chest/Lungs:**

- Breathing easily?
- Lung sounds clear?
- Any wheezing or crackling?

**Heart:**

- Regular rhythm?
- Any murmurs?

**Abdomen:**

- Soft or rigid?

**Skin:**

- Rashes?
- Wounds?
- Color normal?

**Neurological:**

- Alert and oriented?
- Speech normal?

### Assessment and Diagnosis

**Working Diagnosis:**
Your best assessment of what's wrong based on symptoms and exam.

**Differential Diagnoses:**
Other possibilities to consider or rule out. Important for telemedicine consultation.

**Severity Assessment:**

- **Minor:** First aid level, no professional care needed
- **Moderate:** May need professional care but not urgent
- **Serious:** Needs professional care, plan for evacuation
- **Life-Threatening:** Immediate evacuation required

### Treatment Documentation

Record everything:

- Time administered
- Exact medication and dose
- Route (oral, topical, injection, etc.)
- Response (helped, no change, adverse reaction)

**Why detailed records matter:**

- Avoid medication errors
- Track what works
- Professional providers need this info
- Legal protection

### Wound Care

Document carefully:

- Type and size of wound
- How thoroughly cleaned
- Closure method (stitches, steri-strips, glue, left open)
- Bandaging and dressing
- Tetanus status (booster if >5 years and dirty wound, >10 years clean wound)

**Photos:**
Consider photographing wounds for telemedicine consultation and healing documentation.

### Disposition and Follow-up

**Monitor carefully:**

- Vital signs at regular intervals
- Response to treatment
- New or worsening symptoms
- Patient comfort

**Clear instructions:**

- Activity limitations (rest, light duty, etc.)
- Diet changes if needed
- Medication schedule
- When to check back
- Warning signs requiring immediate attention

### Telemedicine Consultation

**Preparation:**

- Complete physical exam and vital signs
- List all symptoms and their timeline
- Document any treatments already given
- Have medical history available
- Note allergies and current medications

**During Consultation:**

- Take detailed notes
- Ask for clarification if uncertain
- Confirm medication names and doses
- Discuss evacuation criteria
- Get follow-up plan

**After Consultation:**

- Document all recommendations
- Implement treatment plan
- Schedule follow-up as directed
- Monitor closely for changes

### Evacuation Decision

**Consider evacuation for:**

- Life-threatening conditions
- Conditions requiring surgery
- Lack of improvement with treatment
- Inadequate resources to treat
- Patient or provider concern

**Evacuation Methods:**

- Own vessel to nearest port
- Coast Guard/navy assistance
- Air evacuation (helicopter/plane)
- Rendezvous with vessel going to port

**Document decision:**

- Why evacuating
- Where going
- How getting there
- Patient status at time of evacuation

### Special Considerations

**Children:**

- Vital signs vary by age
- Weight-based medication dosing
- Higher risk of dehydration
- May not communicate symptoms well
- Parents' intuition important

**Pregnant Women:**

- Limited medication options
- Higher risk for certain conditions
- Evacuation threshold lower
- Specialized medical advice needed

**Chronic Conditions:**

- Track condition stability
- Monitor medication compliance
- Watch for complications
- Maintain adequate medication supply

**Mental Health:**
