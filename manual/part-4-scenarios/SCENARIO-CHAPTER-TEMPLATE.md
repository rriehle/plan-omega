## Writing Guidelines

### Tone and Style

- **Practical, not alarmist**: Focus on actionable responses, not fear
- **Specific, not vague**: "Stock 100 N95 masks" not "get some masks"
- **Realistic, not optimistic**: Acknowledge hard choices and limitations
- **Direct, not academic**: Imperative voice for actions

### Content Priorities

1. **Actionable**: Every section should lead to concrete actions
2. **Maritime-focused**: Land-based survival guides exist; this is boat-specific
3. **Family-oriented**: Address children, elderly, special needs
4. **Tested where possible**: Reference real experiences (COVID, 2008 crash, etc.)

### Integration References

- **Link to Part II chapters** when discussing system modifications
- **Cross-reference other scenarios** when discussing overlaps
- **Reference templates** in planning-templates/ for user tools
- **Connect to Part V protocols** for operational procedures

### Completeness Checklist

Before marking a scenario chapter as ‚úÖ COMPLETE, verify:

- [ ] All template sections completed (not "TBD" or empty)
- [ ] At least 3 destination recommendations with specifics
- [ ] All 6 core systems addressed in "Critical Systems Adaptations"
- [ ] Decision trees have clear, measurable criteria
- [ ] Action items are specific (not "prepare supplies" but "stock 100 N95 masks")
- [ ] At least 2 case studies or historical examples included
- [ ] Drill procedures defined with success criteria
- [ ] Cross-references to other manual sections included
- [ ] Estimated costs provided for scenario-specific supplies
