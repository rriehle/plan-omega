## Overview

Civil unrest encompasses a spectrum of social breakdown ranging from organized protests and strikes to widespread violence, looting, government collapse, and civil war. Unlike economic collapse (which develops over months), civil unrest can escalate from peaceful protests to deadly violence within days or hours. The unpredictability and rapid acceleration of civil unrest make early departure critical once violence begins, escape routes close quickly.

**Historical precedent** shows civil unrest follows predictable escalation patterns: Economic stress or political repression -> peaceful protests -> government crackdown -> violence escalates -> widespread looting/fighting -> government collapse or brutal suppression -> mass exodus of refugees. Syria (2011-present, 6+ million refugees), Venezuela (2014-present, protests -> violent suppression -> 8 million fled), Arab Spring (2010-2012, multiple governments toppled), Rwandan genocide (1994, 800,000 killed, 2 million fled), Yugoslav Wars (1991-2001, 2.4 million displaced), and Somalia (1991-present, ongoing collapse) all demonstrate this progression.

**Maritime families possess critical advantages** during civil unrest: **Mobility to escape before borders close**, physical separation from violence (anchored offshore), ability to monitor situation without direct exposure, hard-to-target (compared to fixed addresses), and international waters as refuge. However, civil unrest creates unique maritime risks: ports become dangerous (violence, official harassment, exit restrictions), coastal areas may have naval blockades or patrols, marinas are targets for looting, and desperate refugees may attempt to board vessels.

**Timeline characteristics:** Civil unrest escalates rapidly peaceful protest to violent chaos can occur in 72 hours (Arab Spring examples). Early stages (protests, strikes) may persist weeks or months before escalation. Once violence begins, window for safe departure closes within days. Duration highly variable: short (days to weeks if government crushes protests), medium (months to years of instability), or permanent (Somalia, decades of collapse).

**Key characteristics:**

- **Primary threat mechanisms:** Violence (riots, armed conflict, genocide), government repression (arrests, disappearances, martial law), infrastructure breakdown (no police, no utilities), maritime restrictions (closed ports, exit prohibitions), targeted attacks (ethnic, political, religious, class-based)
- **Cascading effects:** Economic stress -> protests -> government crackdown -> escalating violence -> infrastructure collapse -> refugee crisis -> regional instability -> piracy/lawlessness
- **Likely duration:** Protests/strikes 1-6 months; violent phase days to years; government collapse immediate or drawn-out; recovery years to decades
- **Geographic variations:** Urban areas most affected (concentration of people, infrastructure); rural/remote areas often safer initially; coastal cities vulnerable to naval restrictions; island nations may avoid worst (geographic isolation)

## Threat Recognition

### Early Warning Indicators

**Stage 1 indicators (Months before violence - "Grievance Stage"):**

- **Economic stress:** Rising unemployment, inflation, shortages, wealth inequality visible
- **Political repression:** Censorship increasing, opposition leaders arrested, elections rigged/cancelled
- **Social tension:** Ethnic, religious, or class divisions hardening; hate speech increasing
- **Peaceful protests:** Small-scale demonstrations, specific grievances, still peaceful
- **Government nervousness:** Increased security presence, defensive rhetoric, minor crackdowns

**Stage 2 indicators (Weeks before violence - "Mobilization Stage"):**

- **Protests growing:** Larger crowds, broader coalitions, more frequent demonstrations
- **Government escalation:** Police violence against protesters, mass arrests, internet shutdowns
- **Opposition organizing:** Leaders calling for sustained action, general strikes announced
- **International concern:** Foreign governments issuing warnings, embassy staff departures
- **Middle class joining:** Protests no longer just poor/marginalized; professionals participating
- **Military positioning:** Troops deployed to cities, checkpoints established

**Stage 3 indicators (Days before violence - "Confrontation Stage"):**

- **Mass protests:** Hundreds of thousands in streets, multiple cities, sustained multi-day actions
- **First casualties:** Police/military fire on protesters; deaths reported
- **Government losing control:** Police/military units defecting, regions declaring autonomy
- **Armed groups forming:** Militias organizing, weapons appearing
- **Sectarian/ethnic attacks beginning:** Targeted violence against minorities, revenge killings
- **Infrastructure disruption:** Roads blocked, airports closing, utilities failing

**Stage 4 indicators (Violence begins - "Collapse Stage"):**

- **Widespread violence:** Fighting in streets, armed clashes, looting
- **Government collapse or martial law:** Total repression or loss of control
- **Borders closing:** Exit restrictions, checkpoints, shoot-to-kill orders
- **Humanitarian crisis:** Hospitals overwhelmed, food/water shortages, mass displacement
- **Ports closed or dangerous:** Naval blockades, armed patrols, vessel searches
- **No rule of law:** Police absent or partisan; armed groups control areas

### Threat Level Mapping

**Level 1: Monitoring**

*Indicators:*

- Economic stress rising
- Peaceful protests (small-scale, sporadic)
- Political repression increasing
- Social tensions evident
- International warnings beginning

*Actions:*

- Monitor news daily (local and international sources)
- Connect with cruising community (VHF/SSB intelligence)
- Identify safe haven destinations and routes
- Enhance provisions to 6-month capacity
- Position vessel for rapid departure (fuel, water topped off)
- Discuss departure plan with family (at what point do we leave?)
- Avoid major cities (anchor in remote locations if feasible)

*Decision point to Level 2:*

- Protests growing in size/frequency
- First reports of police violence
- Government rhetoric becoming threatening
- Cruisers/expats beginning to depart
- International warnings escalate to "reconsider travel" or "do not travel"

**Level 2: Enhanced Readiness**

*Indicators:*

- Large sustained protests (weeks ongoing)
- Police/military violence against protesters (injuries/deaths)
- General strikes or mass mobilization
- Internet/communications disruptions
- Foreigners evacuating (embassies reducing staff)
- Armed groups forming or weapons appearing

*Actions:*

- **Depart within 2 weeks** (prepare immediately)
- Top off all tanks (fuel, water, propane) - fuel stations may close suddenly
- Final provisioning (assume stores will empty or become inaccessible)
- Clear customs/immigration if possible (if still functioning)
- Move to anchorage with direct access to open water (avoid being trapped in bays/harbors)
- Monitor VHF/SSB constantly (situation changing rapidly)
- Brief family: Departure imminent; pack personal items
- Maintain low profile (no displays of wealth, nationality, political views)

*Decision point to Level 3:*

- First deaths in protests
- Government announces martial law or emergency powers
- Fighting/looting begins
- Ports begin restricting departures
- Armed attacks on foreigners or boats reported

**Level 3: Activation (Immediate Departure)**

*Indicators:*

- Widespread violence (fighting, looting, killings)
- Government collapse or total repression
- Borders/ports closing or under military control
- Infrastructure breakdown (no police, no utilities, no communications)
- Targeted violence (ethnic, religious, political, foreign)
- Boats being boarded, looted, or confiscated

*Actions:*

- **DEPART IMMEDIATELY** (within hours, not days)
- If in port/marina: Leave without clearance if necessary (life > paperwork)
- If at anchor: Weigh anchor and head for international waters
- Avoid port entry (bypass customs; depart without clearance if officials absent or hostile)
- Route: Most direct path to international waters, then to safe haven
- Accept significant weather risk (violence more dangerous than storms)
- OPSEC: Radio silence (VHF/SSB off or receive-only); AIS off; no position reports
- Family briefing: Explain danger; assign roles; prepare for potential confrontation
- Defensive posture: Watch 24/7; spotlight ready; evasive maneuvers prepared

*Decision point to Level 4:*

- Successfully departed home country
- Reached international waters or safe haven country
- Ongoing monitoring of home country (is it safe to return?)

**Level 4: Survival Mode (Refuge in Safe Haven)**

*Indicators:*

- Home country experiencing ongoing violence, government collapse, or brutal repression
- No safe return possible for months or years
- Maritime family operating in safe haven country

*Actions:*

- Clear into safe haven country (if customs/immigration functioning)
- Establish secure anchorage
- Connect with cruising community and local population
- Monitor home country situation (SSB/internet/news): Is violence subsiding? Government stabilizing?
- Assess: Can we return? Criteria: Violence ended, government functional, rule of law restored, borders open
- Maintain readiness: If safe haven deteriorates, prepared to relocate again
- Long-term planning: If home country collapse permanent, consider permanent relocation/immigration

### Information Sources

**Local/domestic news (critical for early warning):**

- Local newspapers, TV, radio (unfiltered view of protests, government response)
- Social media (Twitter, Facebook, Telegram - real-time protest reports, videos, eyewitness accounts)
- Opposition media (often more accurate than state-controlled sources in repressive countries)
- **Warning:** Government may shut down internet, social media, or independent media during crackdown

**International news:**

- BBC, Reuters, Al Jazeera, AP - objective reporting on foreign civil unrest
- US State Department travel advisories (or equivalent for your nationality)
- UN reports (humanitarian situation, refugee flows)

**Maritime networks:**

- VHF/SSB cruising nets (real-time reports from other cruisers in country)
- Noonsite.com (country updates, official restrictions, cruiser experiences)
- Cruisers forums (Cruisers Forum, Sailing Anarchy - situation reports)
- Facebook cruising groups (regional groups share local intelligence)
- **Critical:** Other cruisers may have better situational awareness than news media

**On-the-ground indicators:**

- **Bank runs:** Long lines at banks/ATMs (people withdrawing savings before collapse)
- **Fuel lines:** Lines at gas stations (hoarding before shortages)
- **Store shelves:** Empty shelves (panic buying, supply chain breakdown)
- **Traffic patterns:** Mass exodus (cars packed with belongings leaving city)
- **Protest size/frequency:** Escalation visible from boat (noise, smoke, helicopters)
- **Gunfire/explosions:** Violence audible from anchorage
- **Naval/coast guard activity:** Increased patrols, vessels being stopped/searched
- **Fellow cruisers departing:** If other boats leaving suddenly, follow their lead

**Embassy communications:**

- Register with your embassy (warden system: receive emergency notifications)
- Embassy websites (security alerts, evacuation plans)
- **Warning:** If embassy orders evacuation, situation is critical; depart immediately

## Strategic Response

### Overview of Response Strategy

The fundamental civil unrest strategy for maritime families is **early departure before violence escalates**. Unlike economic collapse (which provides months of warning), civil unrest can escalate from peaceful to deadly in days or hours. **The earlier you leave, the higher your survival probability.**

Historical evidence from refugee crises is unambiguous:

- **Depart during Stage 1-2 (peaceful protests, government crackdown beginning):** 90-95% survival rate; wealth intact; orderly departure
- **Depart during Stage 3 (first violence):** 70-80% survival; partial wealth preservation; difficult departure
- **Depart during Stage 4 (widespread violence, government collapse):** 40-60% survival; lose most possessions; dangerous escape
- **Fail to depart (trapped):** <40% survival in worst cases (Rwanda, Syria, Yugoslavia); subject to violence, starvation, persecution

**The cost of early departure is trivial compared to the cost of late departure.** Leaving during Stage 1-2 means: peaceful exit, customs clearance possible, fuel/supplies available, weather can be optimized, family not traumatized. Leaving during Stage 3-4 means: no clearance (illegal departure), fuel scarce/unavailable, violence en route to boat, family terrified, possible confiscation/boarding.

**The strategy:** Monitor continuously; recognize escalation patterns; establish departure triggers (specific indicators that mean "leave now"); execute departure decisively when triggered; relocate to politically stable, neutral country; wait out collapse; return only when safe.

### Primary Strategy: Early Departure (Stage 1-2) to Neutral, Stable Country

**Description:**

Upon detecting Stage 1 indicators (peaceful protests, government nervousness), establish heightened monitoring and prepare for potential departure within 2-4 weeks. Upon detecting Stage 2 indicators (protests growing, police violence, foreigners leaving), execute immediate departure within 3-7 days. Destination: Politically stable, neutral country with no involvement in home country's conflict.

**Key principle:** "Depart when it seems too early; by the time it seems necessary, it's too late."

**Implementation:**

*Stage 1 (Peaceful protests, early warning):*

1. Monitor news daily (local protests, government response, international warnings)
2. Connect with cruising community (are others leaving? what are they seeing?)
3. Position vessel in anchorage with direct access to open water (not trapped in marina or bay)
4. Top off fuel, water, propane (be ready to leave within 48 hours if needed)
5. Provision to 6-12 month capacity (stores may empty suddenly)
6. Clear customs/immigration if planning to depart soon (get paperwork done while system functioning)
7. Research destinations: Which countries are neutral? Visa requirements? Routes?
8. Family meeting: Explain situation; establish departure triggers ("If X happens, we leave immediately")

*Stage 2 (Protests escalating, violence beginning):*

1. **Decision: DEPART WITHIN 3-7 DAYS** (this is last window for safe, legal departure)
2. Final fuel/water top-off (lines may be long; fuel stations may close)
3. Final provisioning (anything you can get; assume stores will empty)
4. Clear customs if still functioning (legal exit preferred; but don't delay departure if clearance impossible)
5. Close out any business (bank accounts, storage, etc.) - but only if safe to go ashore
6. Final communication with family/friends (let them know you're departing; may be last contact for months)
7. **DEPART:** Weight anchor; head for international waters; route to safe haven
8. Maintain OPSEC: Don't broadcast wealth, nationality, or destination on VHF

*Arrival at safe haven (Level 4):*

1. Clear into safe haven country (if customs/immigration functioning)
2. Establish secure anchorage
3. Connect with cruising and local community
4. Monitor home country (SSB/internet/news): When is it safe to return?
5. Assess duration: Weeks? Months? Years? Permanent displacement?
6. If long-term: Establish routines (school for kids, work if possible, community participation)

**Duration:**

Highly variable depending on home country situation:

- **Best case:** Protests suppressed quickly; government stabilizes; safe return in 1-3 months
- **Medium case:** Prolonged instability; government weakened but functional; safe return in 6-18 months
- **Worst case:** Civil war, government collapse, genocide; no safe return for years or decade+ (Syria: 13+ years ongoing; Somalia: 30+ years)

**Advantages:**

- **Early departure (Stage 1-2) = highest survival probability**
- Legal exit possible (customs clearance, no restrictions)
- Peaceful departure (not fleeing under fire)
- Wealth preserved (able to access banks, clear debts, close affairs)
- Family not traumatized (no exposure to violence)
- Can optimize route/weather (not forced departure in bad weather)
- International sympathy (recognized as refugees if needed; assistance available)

**Limitations:**

- **Risk of false alarm:** May depart and unrest doesn't escalate (economic cost of leaving too early)
- Disruption to family (children's education, social ties, routines)
- Visa issues in safe haven (may have time limits on stay)
- Cost (fuel, provisions, safe haven living expenses)
- Uncertainty (don't know how long you'll be gone)

**Risk mitigation for "false alarm":**

- If depart Stage 1 and situation doesn't escalate: Return after 1-2 months; learn from experience
- If depart Stage 2 and situation doesn't escalate: Still correct decision (risk too high to stay)
- **Better to leave 10 times unnecessarily than stay once when you should have left**

### Alternate Strategy: Delayed Departure (Stage 3) - Higher Risk

**Description:**

If unable to depart during Stage 1-2 (mechanical failure, medical emergency, denial/poor judgment), delayed departure during Stage 3 (first violence) is still possible but significantly more dangerous and difficult. Requires accepting:

- Illegal departure likely (no customs clearance)
- Violence en route to vessel (may need to fight through to reach boat)
- Fuel/supplies scarce (may depart under-provisioned)
- Port restrictions possible (may be stopped, boarded, turned back)
- Bad weather acceptable (can't wait for weather window)

**Implementation:**

1. **Immediate departure decision:** If Stage 3 indicators appear, depart within 12-48 hours
2. Assess route to vessel: Is it safe to reach boat? (If in marina or distant anchorage, getting to vessel may be most dangerous part)
3. If ashore: Gather family, minimal possessions, reach vessel by fastest/safest route (car, dinghy, on foot)
4. If aboard: Weigh anchor immediately; skip customs clearance if dangerous/impossible
5. Route planning: Most direct to international waters; avoid contested areas, naval patrols, choke points
6. Departure timing: Night departure may be safer (less visible) or more dangerous (harder to see threats); assess based on situation
7. OPSEC critical: Radio silence; AIS off; tell NO ONE your route/destination
8. Defense readiness: Armed watch 24/7; spotlight ready; prepared to repel boarders or flee
9. Monitor VHF (receive only): Situation reports from other vessels

**Duration:** Same as Primary Strategy (weeks to years depending on home country)

**Advantages:**

- Still possible to escape (many refugees successfully flee during Stage 3)
- Boat provides mobility that land refugees lack

**Limitations:**

- **High risk:** Violence en route, naval restrictions, illegal departure
- **Trauma:** Family exposed to violence, fear
- **Wealth loss:** Unable to access banks, close affairs, sell property
- **Under-provisioned:** May depart with inadequate fuel/food/water
- **Legal issues:** Illegal departure may cause problems in safe haven (overstays in home country, no clearance)

### Contingency Strategy: Trapped in Country (Stage 4) - Extreme Risk

**Description:**

**Worst case scenario:** Failed to depart before Stage 4 (widespread violence, government collapse, borders closed). Vessel trapped in home country (in port, marina, or anchorage). Multiple dangers: violence, looting, confiscation, targeted attacks (if foreign or "wrong" ethnicity/religion/class), starvation, disease.

**Options (all dangerous):**

**Option A: Hide on vessel (offshore anchorage)**

- If anchored far offshore: May escape notice of armed groups
- Stay aboard; maintain 24/7 watch; repel looters if necessary
- Fish for food (stores empty; supply chains broken)
- Minimize shore contact (only if absolutely necessary, armed, daylight only)
- Monitor situation (SSB/radio): When does violence subside? When can you depart?
- Risk: Discovered and boarded; confiscated; murdered

**Option B: Attempt illegal departure (running blockade)**

- If borders closed but vessel still accessible: Attempt night departure
- Risk: Shot by naval patrol; stopped and confiscated; turned back
- Preparation: Depart with no lights; AIS off; radar-reflective materials removed; nighttime only; fastest route to international waters
- High-risk; many killed attempting this (Vietnam boat people, Syrian refugees)

**Option C: Scuttle vessel and shelter ashore**

- If vessel certain to be confiscated/destroyed: Scuttle (sink) to deny looters
- Shelter with locals (if you have trusted local friends/community)
- Pose as local (if possible; learn language/customs; blend in)
- Wait out violence ashore; flee overland if opportunity arises
- Risk: Killed in violence; starvation; persecution

**Option D: Surrender vessel to authorities**

- If government still functional and vessel being confiscated: Negotiate surrender
- Exchange: Vessel for exit permits, safe passage, or protection
- Move to refugee camp or neighboring country overland
- Risk: Lose vessel; authorities may not honor agreement; may be arrested/detained

**Implementation:**

Depends on specific situation (which option chosen). No clear procedure; extreme danger in all scenarios.

**Duration:** Weeks to months until violence subsides or escape opportunity arises

**Advantages:**

- Surviving is an advantage (many don't survive Stage 4)

**Limitations:**

- **Extreme risk of death:** 40-60% survival rate in worst civil wars/genocides
- **Trauma:** Profound psychological damage (PTSD likely)
- **Wealth loss:** Lose boat, savings, possessions
- **Health:** Malnutrition, disease, injury common

**Outcome:** If you survive, you likely lose boat and most possessions. Many refugees in this situation die. **Avoid this scenario at all costs by departing Stage 1-2.**

### Emergency Strategy: Vessel Captured/Family Separated - Survival Focus

**Description:**

**Absolute worst case:** Vessel boarded/confiscated; family separated; some members ashore, some aboard; violence immediate.

**Priorities (in order):**

1. **Survive:** Comply with armed groups (do not resist if outgunned); surrender valuables (life > property)
2. **Reunite family:** Primary goal is getting family back together
3. **Escape:** Once reunited, flee by any means (overland, hidden aboard another vessel, bribe officials)
4. **Contact authorities:** If foreign national, contact embassy (if still functioning) for rescue/evacuation

**Implementation:**

No standard procedure; entirely situational. Some guidelines:

- **Do not resist armed groups unless fighting is only option (certain death vs. possible death)**
- **Valuables:** Surrender willingly; do not hide (if discovered, will be tortured/killed)
- **Communication:** If VHF/SSB still accessible, broadcast MAYDAY; provide position; request assistance
- **Embassy:** If captured, demand to contact embassy (if foreign national); may provide protection
- **Bribery:** If family separated, use hidden cash to bribe officials/guards for reunion
- **Locals:** If you have trusted local friends, reach out for shelter/assistance
- **Last resort:** If certain death, attempt escape even if dangerous

**Duration:** Hours to days (immediate survival situation)

**Outcome:** Survival uncertain; expect to lose vessel and possessions; PTSD likely; **prevention through early departure is only reliable strategy**

## Critical Systems Adaptations

### Water Systems

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

Civil unrest disrupts urban water infrastructure (workers flee, utilities sabotaged, power fails). Shore water likely unsafe (contamination) or unavailable. However, water at sea and rainwater unaffected by civil unrest.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Watermaker (assume shore water unavailable/unsafe)
  - Ensure spare membranes, pumps, chemicals
  - Test before departure (no repair parts available during unrest)
- **Alternate:** Rainwater catchment (reliable; civil unrest doesn't affect weather)
  - Maximize catchment area; clean/test system
- **Contingency:** Emergency desalinator (manual) + water purification tablets
- **Emergency:** Rainwater only + severe rationing (0.5 gal/person/day)

**Special requirements:**

- **Avoid shore water entirely** (contamination risk; infrastructure breakdown)
- Stock 2-year supply water purification tablets (backup if systems fail)

### Food Systems

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

Supply chains collapse rapidly during civil unrest (roads blocked, looting, workers flee). Stores empty within days. Fishing becomes primary food source.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** 6-12 month provisions + fishing
  - Heavily provision before departure (assume no resupply for months)
  - Develop fishing skills (critical for extending provisions)
- **Alternate:** Fishing + foraging + local trade (in safe haven)
- **Contingency:** Fishing only (provisions exhausted)
- **Emergency:** Survival fishing + severe rationing

**Special requirements:**

- **Provision heavily before Stage 3** (stores empty once violence begins)
- Extensive fishing gear (primary food source if trapped or in extended refuge)
- Non-perishable focus (no refrigeration if power fails)

### Shelter/Vessel

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

Vessel may be damaged by stray fire, looting attempts, or confiscation. Haul-out impossible during unrest (boatyards closed). Must maintain seaworthiness with onboard resources.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Preventive maintenance + comprehensive spares
  - Complete all maintenance before unrest escalates (no repairs possible during Stage 3-4)
  - Stock extensive spares (engine, rigging, sails, hull repair)
- **Alternate:** DIY repair using spares
- **Contingency:** Improvised repair
- **Emergency:** Abandon vessel if unseaworthy or about to be confiscated

**Special requirements:**

- Bullet/explosion damage repair capability (fiberglass patches, epoxy, wood, sealant)
- Fire suppression (civil unrest involves arson; fire extinguishers critical)

### Energy/Power

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

Shore power unavailable (infrastructure collapse). Fuel scarce or unavailable (supply chains broken, hoarding). Solar/wind unaffected by civil unrest.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Solar + wind (fuel-independent)
  - Maximize solar/wind capacity
  - Maintain batteries meticulously
- **Alternate:** Diesel generator (extreme rationing of fuel)
  - Top off all fuel tanks before Stage 3 (may be last opportunity for years)
- **Contingency:** Solar only + severe rationing
- **Emergency:** No electrical power (oil lamps, hand-crank radios)

**Special requirements:**

- **Fuel critical:** Top off during Stage 1-2; may not be available during/after violence
- Solar/wind redundancy (primary power source for extended period)

### Medical/Healthcare

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

**Hospitals targeted during civil unrest** (deliberate attacks, lack of power/supplies, doctors flee). Medical care unavailable or extremely dangerous to access. Trauma injuries (gunshot, blast, shrapnel) more likely.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Comprehensive medical kit + trauma training
  - **Trauma focus:** Gunshot/blast/shrapnel injuries; severe bleeding; burns
  - Wilderness First Responder training (80 hours; scenario-based trauma care)
  - Extensive supplies: Tourniquets, hemostatic gauze, chest seals, pressure bandages, sutures
  - Antibiotics (full spectrum; 12-24 month supply)
  - Pain management (trauma = severe pain)
- **Alternate:** Cruiser network (other boats' medical expertise/supplies)
- **Contingency:** Local healers (if in safe haven; traditional medicine)
- **Emergency:** Evacuation (EPIRB; contact other vessels; sail to nearest functioning hospital may be 1,000+ miles)

**Special requirements:**

- **Trauma supplies:** Tourniquets (3-4), hemostatic gauze, chest seals, pressure bandages
- **Antibiotics:** Aggressive infection treatment (wounds in austere environment = high infection risk)
- **Psychological:** Trauma counseling resources (books, self-help; PTSD management)

### Defense/Security

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

**Defense is most critical system during civil unrest.** Threats include: armed looters, militias, desperate refugees attempting to board, government forces confiscating vessels, pirates.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Avoidance + distance
  - **Depart before violence (Stage 1-2):** Avoids all threats
  - Remote anchorages far from shore (hard to reach; out of sight)
  - International waters (beyond government/militia reach)
  - OPSEC: Radio silence, AIS off, no position broadcasts
- **Alternate:** Hardening + deterrence
  - Anchor in deep water (attackers need boat to reach you)
  - 24/7 armed watch (visible presence deters)
  - Spotlight, loud hailer (warn off)
  - Locked companionway, secured dinghy
  - Buddy boat with other cruisers (safety in numbers)
- **Contingency:** Active defense (non-lethal)
  - Spotlight (blind attackers)
  - Flares (warning shots; illuminate)
  - Evasive maneuvers (start engine, flee)
  - Fire hoses (repel boarders)
  - Defensive positions (all family members know roles)
- **Emergency:** Lethal defense
  - Firearms (if legal, crew trained)
  - **Last resort:** Use only if life-threatening attack underway
  - Aim: Repel boarders and escape, not prolonged firefight

**Special requirements:**

- **Firearms:** Consider legality, training, storage, rules of engagement
  - Check safe haven country laws (many prohibit entry with firearms)
  - Store in bond if required
  - Training: All adults proficient; know when NOT to use (surrender if outgunned)
- **Radar:** Detect approaching vessels at night (early warning)
- **Night vision:** If available; spot threats in darkness
- **Communications:** VHF/SSB to call for help; EPIRB if attacked

**Rules of engagement:**

- **Avoid conflict:** Run if possible (start engine, cut anchor if needed, flee)
- **Warn:** Spotlight, loud hailer, warning shots (flares) before lethal force
- **Proportional response:** Do not use lethal force against unarmed looters; use against armed attackers
- **Escape priority:** Goal is to escape, not to "win" a fight
- **Surrender if outgunned:** Life > property; surrender boat/valuables if necessary to survive
