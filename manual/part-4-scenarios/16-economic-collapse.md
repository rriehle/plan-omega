## Overview

Economic collapse scenarios range from severe recessions and depressions to complete currency failure and hyperinflation. Unlike sudden catastrophes, economic collapses typically develop over months or years, providing warning signs for those monitoring carefully. History shows these scenarios follow predictable patterns: asset bubbles burst, credit contracts, currencies fail, supply chains break down, and social order deteriorates as desperation grows.

**Historical precedent** demonstrates economic collapses occur with regularity: the Great Depression (1929-1941, 25% unemployment), Weimar Germany hyperinflation (1923, 4.2 trillion marks to 1 USD), Zimbabwe (2008, 89.7 sextillion percent inflation), Venezuela (2015-present, 8 million fled), Argentina (2001, banking freeze and peso collapse), and the 2008 global financial crisis. Each followed similar patterns: warning signs appeared 12-24 months early, those with mobility and tangible assets survived better, and fixed-income populations suffered catastrophic losses.

**Maritime families possess unique advantages** during economic collapse: mobility to relocate before capital controls, fishing for food independence when supply chains fail, ability to hold and use multiple currencies, valuable barter skills (boat repair, navigation, medical), and self-sufficiency in water and power. The sailing vessel itself is a tangible, mobile asset that cannot be inflated away. Historical evidence shows those who recognized early warnings, converted paper wealth to tangible assets, and relocated to functioning economies fared dramatically better than those trapped in collapsing systems.

**Timeline characteristics:** Economic collapses develop gradually (12-24 months from first warning signs to crisis), accelerate rapidly once banking or currency systems fail, and persist for years (Great Depression: 12 years; typical recession: 10-18 months; hyperinflation: months to years). Recovery to pre-crisis levels often takes much longer than the collapse itself.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Primary threat mechanisms:** Currency devaluation/hyperinflation, banking freezes (corralito), supply chain breakdown, unemployment, asset confiscation, violence/looting driven by desperation
- **Cascading effects:** Economic collapse -> civil unrest (looting, protests) -> piracy/maritime violence -> regional instability -> migration crises
- **Likely duration:** Severe recessions 10-18 months; depressions 3-12 years; hyperinflation months to years; recovery much longer
- **Geographic variations:** Advanced economies hit harder in deflationary collapses; developing economies more vulnerable to currency crises; commodity exporters (especially food) fare better; dollarized economies more stable

## Threat Recognition

### Early Warning Indicators

**Primary indicators (12-24 months advance warning):**

- **Inverted yield curve** - Short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates (most reliable predictor)
- **Rising unemployment claims** - Sustained increase by 20-25% from cyclical low; Sahm Rule: 3-month moving average rises 0.5+ percentage points
- **Asset bubbles** - Extreme valuations in housing, stocks, or other assets disconnected from fundamentals
- **Rapid credit expansion** - Credit growing much faster than GDP; debt-to-GDP ratios climbing rapidly

**Secondary indicators (3-12 months warning):**

- **Manufacturing surveys declining** - PMI below 50 indicates contraction
- **Housing starts and home sales dropping** sharply
- **Consumer confidence falling** - Multiple consecutive months of decline

## Strategic Response

### Overview of Response Strategy

The fundamental economic collapse strategy for maritime families is **early departure to a stable, food-independent destination while preserving wealth in hard assets**. This strategy leverages the unique advantages of mobility and self-sufficiency that sailing vessels provide.

The approach has four components: (1) **Early warning recognition** using economic indicators to gain 12-24 months preparation time; (2) **Wealth preservation** by converting paper assets to hard currency, precious metals, and provisioned goods; (3) **Timely departure** before capital controls or exit restrictions trap you; (4) **Relocation to safe haven** with stable currency, food independence capability, and minimal global economic integration.

**Historical evidence is overwhelming:** Those who recognized warning signs early, converted wealth to tangible assets, and relocated to functioning economies survived with wealth intact. Those who waitedtrusting their government, their currency, their bankslost 70-100% of their savings and often faced violence, starvation, or forced to flee with nothing. The window between "things seem fine" and "complete collapse" can be as short as weeks (Argentina's corralito) or as long as years (Venezuela), but capital controls and exit restrictions appear suddenly and without warning.

### Primary Strategy: Early Departure to Dollarized Economy or Remote Pacific Haven

**Description:**

Upon detecting Level 2 warning indicators (12-24 months before crisis peak), begin accelerated provisioning and wealth conversion. When Level 3 indicators appear (banking stress, hyperinflation beginning, capital controls), execute immediate departure to pre-selected safe haven. Primary destinations: dollarized economies (Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama) or remote Pacific islands with food independence (Marquesas, French Polynesia).

**Dollarized economies** offer currency stability (use USD as legal tender), protection from local hyperinflation, and continued access to international banking/commerce. They import stable prices from the United States and avoid the currency devaluation that destroys savings.

**Remote Pacific havens** (especially Marquesas) offer complete food independence through abundant fishing, zero cyclone risk, minimal global economic integration, and self-sufficient local communities. When global economic systems collapse, these locations become nearly immune due to subsistence capabilities and geographic isolation.

**Implementation:**

*Pre-departure (Level 1-2, months to years before):*

1. Convert 50-75% of savings to USD, Swiss francs, euros (physical cash and foreign bank accounts)
2. Purchase physical silver (1 oz coins) equivalent to 6-12 months living expenses
3. Provision vessel to 12-month capacity (food, fuel, water, spares)
4. Acquire barter goods ($2,000-3,000: cigarettes, alcohol, coffee, batteries, medicines)
5. Ensure all boat systems at 100% functionality; purchase critical spares
6. Develop fishing skills and equipment to professional level
7. Study navigation routes to target destinations; acquire charts
8. Establish communication plan (SSB nets, satellite, check-in protocols)

*Departure execution (Level 3, immediate):*

1. Top off all tanks (fuel, water, propane)
2. Final provisioning (fresh produce, medications, any last essentials)
3. Clear customs/immigration (if still functioning)
4. Secure all gear for sea passage
5. Brief crew on watch schedules, emergency procedures
6. Activate OPSEC protocols: No discussion of wealth, supplies, destination on VHF; AIS off in risky areas
7. Final weather check
8. **Depart**

*Arrival and establishment (Level 4):*

1. Clear into safe haven country (if customs/immigration functioning)
2. Establish secure anchorage
3. Connect with cruising community and local population
4. Begin fishing immediately to extend provisions
5. Develop barter relationships: boat repair skills for fish/produce
6. Use hard currency only for essential purchases
7. Maintain low profile (no displays of wealth)
8. Establish routine: fishing, maintenance, community participation
9. Monitor home economy via SSB/satellite for recovery signs

**Duration:**

Minimum 6-12 months; potentially years. Great Depression lasted 12 years. Venezuela crisis ongoing since 2015 (10+ years). Argentina took 18+ months to stabilize. Historical evidence: Plan for 2-5 years in safe haven.

**Advantages:**

- **Currency stability:** Dollarized economies avoid hyperinflation; your USD maintains value
- **Food independence:** Pacific fishing provides renewable food source; not dependent on broken supply chains
- **Mobility preserved:** Can relocate again if safe haven deteriorates
- **Wealth preserved:** Hard currency and precious metals maintain value while home currency collapses
- **Early departure:** Acting before 95% of population means avoiding violence, capital controls, exit restrictions
- **Skills valued:** Boat repair, medical, navigation skills highly valuable for barter in any economy

**Limitations:**

- **Distance:** Pacific destinations require long passages (2-4 weeks from Americas)
- **Weather windows:** Seasonal; may need to depart in non-optimal weather
- **Children's education:** Disrupted formal schooling (mitigated by homeschooling/distance learning)
- **Medical access:** Limited in remote locations (must be self-sufficient)
- **Social isolation:** Remote anchorages lack social infrastructure
- **Cost:** Requires significant capital to provision and hold hard currency reserves ($15,000-30,000 minimum)
- **Irreversibility:** Once departed and home economy collapses further, returning may be impossible for years

### Alternate Strategy: Relocate to Stable Country That Weathered Previous Crises Well

**Description:**

If Pacific destinations are too remote or family prefers access to modern infrastructure, relocate to countries that weathered the 2008 crisis successfully: those with strong pre-crisis fiscal positions, well-regulated banking, flexible exchange rates, and commodity exports (especially food). Primary examples: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Chile.

These countries demonstrated resilience through sound fiscal management, avoided housing/credit bubbles, maintained functional banking systems, and used fiscal/monetary policy effectively during crises.

**Implementation:**

1. Research visa requirements and entry restrictions for target countries
2. Establish presence before crisis (cruising permits, long-stay visas)
3. Position vessel in secure marina or anchorage in target country
4. Develop local connections and community
5. Maintain hard currency reserves and local currency in stable country banks
6. Use local economy (stable currency) while monitoring home economy
7. Maintain boat as departure option if safe haven country deteriorates

**Duration:** 1-5 years depending on home economy recovery

**Advantages:**

- Modern infrastructure (medical, education, communications)
- Stable currencies (CAD, AUD, NZD, SEK, NOK)
- Rule of law maintained
- Banking systems functional
- Social services available
- English-speaking in several options

**Limitations:**

- Visa restrictions may limit stay
- Higher cost of living than remote Pacific
- Still exposed to some global economic contagion
- May require work permits/income source
- Less food-independent than remote fishing areas

### Contingency Strategy: Barter Economy Participation in Subsistence Region

**Description:**

If unable to depart before capital controls (trapped), or if all major economies collapse simultaneously (global depression), relocate to nearest subsistence economy region where barter networks function and local food production continues. Focus on remote coastal villages with fishing and farming; minimal integration with global financial system.

**Implementation:**

1. Sail to nearest region with subsistence agriculture/fishing and minimal global integration
2. Examples: Remote Mexican fishing villages, Central American coastal communities, Caribbean island subsistence economies
3. Offer boat repair, medical, fishing, and navigation skills in exchange for food, fuel, local goods
4. Use barter goods (cigarettes, alcohol, medicines) for essentials
5. Fish heavily to supplement and extend provisions
6. Integrate with local community (learn language, participate in community life, contribute skills)
7. Maintain hard currency reserves hidden for emergencies
8. Minimize expenditures; maximize self-sufficiency

**Duration:** 6 months to 5+ years

**Advantages:**

- Shorter distance than Pacific (can be executed quickly)
- Local economies less affected by global financial system collapse
- Subsistence skills (fishing, farming) continue functioning
- Barter systems emerge naturally in these communities
- Lower cost (use skills instead of cash)

**Limitations:**

- Security risk (desperation drives crime)
- Limited medical access
- Infrastructure minimal
- May face resentment from struggling locals
- Political instability likely
- Piracy risk in some regions

### Emergency Strategy: Deep Ocean Subsistence (Extreme Self-Sufficiency)

**Description:**

**Last resort** if all coastal areas unsafe due to piracy, violence, or government asset confiscation. Operate vessel as completely autonomous unit in international waters or extremely remote anchorages, relying entirely on fishing, rainwater catchment, solar/wind power, and onboard provisions. Minimize all contact with shore.

**Implementation:**

1. Sail to remote oceanic region with reliable fishing and low traffic
2. Examples: Remote Pacific atolls (Chesterfield Reefs, Minerva Reefs), Southern Ocean islands
3. Establish routine: fishing for 100% protein, rainwater catchment for water, solar/wind for power
4. Grow sprouts/microgreens aboard for vitamins
5. Maintain vessel systems through DIY repair using spare parts
6. Communication via SSB nets only; no position broadcasts
7. Monitor global situation for signs of recovery
8. Relocate only when absolutely necessary (fuel conservation)

**Duration:** 3-12 months maximum (psychological strain, medical risk, weather vulnerability)

**Advantages:**

- Complete independence from collapsed economies
- No exposure to violence, asset confiscation, or piracy
- Fishing in open ocean/remote atolls often excellent
- No government interference

**Limitations:**

- **Extreme psychological stress** (isolation, monotony, fear)
- **Medical emergencies catastrophic** (no access to care)
- **Weather vulnerability** (cyclones, storms with no refuge)
- **Equipment failure critical** (no resupply for repairs)
- **Children's well-being** severely impacted
- **Sustainability questionable** beyond a few months
- **Illegal in some jurisdictions** (extended stay in territorial waters without clearance)

## Critical Systems Adaptations

### Water Systems

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

Economic collapse typically does not directly affect water availability at sea, but port water may become unsafe (treatment chemical shortages) or unavailable (infrastructure failure, fuel shortages for pumps). Watermaker becomes critical as primary solution; shore water should be avoided.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Watermaker (assume no reliable shore water) - ensure spare membranes (2+), spare pumps, full chemical supply
- **Alternate:** Rainwater catchment (economic collapse doesn't affect rain) - maximize collection capability
- **Contingency:** Emergency desalinator (Katadyn Survivor 06) - manual, no power/parts needed
- **Emergency:** Rainwater only + severe rationing (0.5 gal/person/day)

**Special requirements:**

- Avoid shore water entirely (contamination risk during infrastructure collapse)
- Stock extra watermaker membranes (replacements may be unavailable for years)
- Test rainwater catchment system thoroughly (primary backup)
- Water purification tablets (2-year supply) for emergency

### Food Systems

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

**This is the most critical system during economic collapse.** Supply chains break down, stores empty, hyperinflation makes food unaffordable even if available. Fishing transitions from supplement to primary food source. Ability to fish effectively determines survival duration.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Fishing + 12-month non-perishable provisions
  - Develop professional-level fishing skills *before* crisis
  - Extensive gear: trolling lures (squid lures for Pacific), handlines, spearfishing equipment, nets (check local regulations)
  - Provision heavily: rice, beans, canned goods, dried foods, cooking oil, salt, spices
  - Target: 12 months for family of four = ~1,500 lbs dry goods + canned protein
- **Alternate:** Extend provisions through fishing + foraging
  - Fish daily; preserve excess (smoking, salting, canning if possible)
  - Forage local: coconuts, breadfruit, tropical fruits (Pacific); conch, lobster (Caribbean - if not overfished)
  - Trade barter goods for local produce
- **Contingency:** Fishing only + local trade
  - Provisions exhausted; rely entirely on daily fishing
  - Trade boat repair/medical services for local farmed/foraged food
  - Grow sprouts aboard (mung beans, alfalfa - small space, fast growing)
- **Emergency:** Survival fishing + severe rationing
  - Minimum calories (1,200-1,500/person/day)
  - Every family member fishing daily
  - Consume everything caught (including bait fish if necessary)

**Special requirements:**

- **Practice fishing NOW** - cannot learn during crisis
- Stock spare fishing gear (lures break, line wears, hooks lost)
- Preserve/smoking equipment (extend fish shelf life)
- Comprehensive spice supply (monotonous diet psychological burden)
- Fishing reference book (species identification, preparation)
- Vitamin supplements (12-month supply) to prevent deficiencies

### Shelter/Vessel

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

Vessel becomes permanent home for potentially years. Haul-out may be impossible (boatyards non-functional, no money). Must maintain seaworthiness indefinitely using only onboard spares and DIY skills.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Preventive maintenance + comprehensive spares
  - Complete bottom job before departure (may be years before next haul-out)
  - Inspect all through-hulls, seacocks, hoses; replace anything questionable
  - Stock extensive spare parts: hoses, clamps, epoxy, fiberglass cloth/resin, wood, fasteners, sealants
  - Reference: *Nigel Calder's Boatowner's Mechanical and Electrical Manual*
- **Alternate:** DIY repair using spares
  - All repairs done by crew using onboard resources
  - Welding/metalwork: establish relationship with local craftsman in safe haven (trade for services)
- **Contingency:** Improvised repair using salvaged materials
  - Cannibalizing non-critical systems for parts
  - Beach vessel for emergency bottom work (careening)
  - Trade barter goods for materials from other cruisers
- **Emergency:** Abandon vessel if unseaworthy
  - Transfer to another cruiser vessel
  - Shore living in safe haven (if possible)
  - Salvage critical gear before abandoning

**Special requirements:**

- Bottom paint (extra gallons for years between haul-outs)
- Underwater epoxy (hull repairs without haul-out)
- Comprehensive fiberglass repair kit
- Sacrificial anodes (multiple; corrosion protection critical)
- Detailed maintenance log (track all systems, anticipate failures)

### Energy/Power

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

Shore power likely unavailable (power grid failures). Fuel expensive or unavailable. Solar/wind become primary; diesel generator emergency only. Battery bank health critical (replacements unavailable).

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Solar + wind (fuel-independent)
  - Maximize solar: 400-800W minimum for family of four
  - Wind generator (Air Marine, Superwind)
  - Maintain batteries meticulously (battery failure = catastrophic)
- **Alternate:** Diesel generator (fuel rationing)
  - Run only for critical needs (watermaker, refrigeration, battery charging)
  - Ration fuel: Calculate daily consumption; make fuel last 12+ months
- **Contingency:** Solar only + severe power rationing
  - Eliminate refrigeration (switch to dry foods, fishing daily)
  - LED lights only; minimal electronics
  - Hand-crank backup for critical items
- **Emergency:** No electrical power
  - Oil lamps for light
  - Hand-crank for VHF/SSB (emergency communications)
  - Manual watermaker (Katadyn Survivor)
  - No refrigeration, no navigation electronics (paper charts, sextant)

**Special requirements:**

- Spare charge controller (solar/wind)
- Battery hydrometer (monitor battery health)
- Multimeter (diagnostics)
- LED bulbs (all fixtures)
- Fuel filters and additives (preserve diesel 12+ months)
- Reference: *The 12-Volt Bible for Boats*

### Medical/Healthcare

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

**Second most critical system.** Medical facilities in collapsed economies non-functional. Medications unavailable or unaffordable. Remote locations lack any medical access. Family must be entirely self-sufficient for minor illness, injury, dental, chronic conditions.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Comprehensive onboard medical kit + training
  - 12-month supply of all prescription medications (minimum; 24 months better)
  - Broad-spectrum antibiotics (fish antibiotics if prescriptions unavailable): amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, metronidazole
  - Dental emergency kit (temporary fillings, extraction tools if necessary)
  - Extensive first aid: sutures, wound closure strips, bandages, antiseptics, pain management
  - References: *Where There Is No Doctor*, *Where There Is No Dentist*, *The Onboard Medical Handbook*
  - Training: Wilderness First Aid or Wilderness First Responder course before departure
- **Alternate:** Local traditional medicine + cruiser network
  - Identify medicinal plants in safe haven region
  - Connect with other cruisers (trade medical supplies, share expertise)
  - Local healers in subsistence economies (traditional treatments)
- **Contingency:** Minimal medical intervention + prevention focus
  - Avoid injury through extreme caution
  - Treat infections aggressively with remaining antibiotics
  - Pain management using remaining supplies
- **Emergency:** Evacuation via cruiser network or emergency services
  - Contact other vessels via SSB for assistance/transport
  - EPIRB activation if life-threatening (if rescue services still functional)
  - Sail to nearest functioning medical facility (may be thousands of miles)

**Special requirements:**

- **Chronic medications:** Absolute minimum 12 months; 24 months strongly recommended
- Antibiotic variety (different classes for different infections)
- Pain management: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, stronger options if legally obtainable
- Antifungals (tropical climates)
- Antimalarials if heading to endemic regions
- Wound care extensive (infections major risk)
- Blood pressure cuff, thermometer, stethoscope, pulse oximeter
- Female hygiene products (2-year supply)

### Defense/Security

**Scenario-specific considerations:**

**Security threats escalate dramatically during economic collapse.** Venezuela and Caribbean examples show cash-starved fishermen turn to piracy. Coastal areas near collapsed economies become high-risk. Desperation drives violence and looting. However, remote anchorages and open ocean remain safe.

**P.A.C.E. priorities for this scenario:**

- **Primary:** Avoidance (remote locations, situational awareness)
  - Monitor VHF/SSB for piracy reports
  - Avoid coastal areas near collapsed economies
  - Remote anchorages (Marquesas, outer Pacific islands)
  - Night watches in any anchorage
  - AIS off when in risky areas (don't broadcast position)
  - Radar watch (detect approaching vessels)
- **Alternate:** Hardening and deterrence
  - Lock vessel when ashore
  - Secure dinghy/outboard (theft common)
  - Remove valuables from deck when anchored
  - Show of vigilance (lights, movement on deck)
  - Buddy boat with other cruisers (safety in numbers)
- **Contingency:** Active defense (non-lethal deterrence)
  - Spotlight (blind attackers)
  - Air horn, flares (attract attention, scare off)
  - Evasive maneuvering (start engine, prepare to flee)
  - Defensive briefing: family knows roles and procedures
- **Emergency:** Lethal defense (last resort, legal in international waters)
  - Firearms if legally carried and crew trained
  - **Check local laws:** Many countries prohibit firearm entry; must declare or secure in bond
  - Use only if life-threatening attack underway
  - Aim: Repel boarders, escape, not engage in prolonged conflict

**Special requirements:**

- Radar (detect approaching vessels at night)
- Spotlight (1 million+ candlepower)
- Flares (parachute and handheld)
- SSB radio (monitor piracy reports on cruising nets)
- Secure storage for valuables (hidden compartments)
- Reference: *The Modern Cruising Sailor's Security Handbook*

## Destination Selection

### Ideal Destination Characteristics

**What makes a location suitable for economic collapse:**

1. **Currency stability** - Dollarized economy (uses USD) or stable national currency (Swiss franc, Norwegian krone, Canadian dollar) protects wealth from hyperinflation
2. **Food independence** - Abundant fishing, local agriculture, minimal dependence on imports; ability to survive without global supply chains
3. **Political stability** - Strong institutions, rule of law, low corruption; government unlikely to confiscate assets or restrict exit
4. **Minimal global integration** - Limited exposure to global financial contagion; subsistence economy components insulate from worldwide collapse
5. **Low piracy risk** - Remote location or effective coast guard/navy; historical absence of maritime violence
6. **Cruiser-friendly** - Welcoming to foreign vessels, reasonable fees, no harassment
7. **Medical access** - Basic medical care available (or community small enough to provide mutual aid)
8. **Weather safety** - Protection from cyclones/hurricanes, safe anchorages, haul-out options (or no haul-out needed)
9. **Visa flexibility** - Long-stay options or tolerant enforcement (can remain for months/years if needed)
10. **Community** - Other cruisers or welcoming locals; social support critical for psychological health

### Geographic Recommendations

**Region 1: French Polynesia (Especially Marquesas Islands)**

**Why it's suitable:**

French Polynesiaparticularly the Marquesasrepresents the *optimal* economic collapse destination for maritime families. The Marquesas have **zero cyclone risk** (never affected), abundant fishing (simple squid lure guarantees catch), protected anchorages, and complete food independence capability. The islands are thousands of miles from collapsed economies, minimizing piracy risk and providing isolation from contagion. Local economy is subsistence-based (fishing, farming), so global financial collapse has minimal impact. French governance provides rule of law and security, but remoteness means self-sufficiency required.

**Specific advantages for economic collapse:**

- **Currency stability:** Uses CFP franc (pegged to euro); some dollarization in tourism areas
- **Food independence:** Best fishing in world west of Panama; local farming produces breadfruit, coconuts, tropical fruits
- **Weather:** Marquesas have zero cyclone risk; Tahiti/Moorea have cyclone holes (Phaeton Bay)
- **Remote:** Isolation protects from piracy and political instability elsewhere
- **Cruiser infrastructure:** Anchorages documented; some services available (but expensive)

**Risks and considerations:**

- **Distance:** 2-4 week passage from Americas
- **Cost:** French Polynesia expensive (but fishing/foraging reduces costs)
- **Limited medical:** Marquesas have basic clinics; serious care requires Tahiti (flight or sail)
- **Visa:** French Polynesia typically grants 90-day stays; extensions possible but not guaranteed (overstay tolerance varies)
- **Weather window:** Arrive before cyclone season (November-April); May-October safest

**Example anchorages:**

- **Nuku Hiva:** Anaho Bay (north coast, protected), Taiohae Bay (services)
- **Hiva Oa:** Atuona (Gauguin museum, supplies)
- **Fatu Hiva:** Hanavave (Bay of Virgins - stunning, protected)
- **Tahiti:** Phaeton Bay (cyclone hole), Papeete (services but expensive)
- **Moorea:** Opunohu Bay, Cooks Bay (protected, scenic)

**Region 2: Dollarized Economies (Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama)**

**Why suitable:**

These countries adopted the USD as legal tender, providing **complete protection from local currency hyperinflation**. When home currency collapses, your USD maintains value and purchasing power increases dramatically. Dollarization assures imported stable prices and lower interest rates from the United States, creates stable capital markets, and ends sudden capital outflows.

**Specific advantages for economic collapse:**

- **Currency stability:** Your USD *is* the local currency; no exchange rate risk
- **Proximity:** Easier to reach from North America (weeks vs. months to Pacific)
- **Infrastructure:** Modern amenities (medical, communications, supplies) still available if economy remains functional
- **Cruising infrastructure:** Marinas, haul-outs, chandleries, repairs
- **Visa flexibility:** Vary by country; Ecuador historically welcoming

**Risks and considerations:**

- **Global integration:** More exposed to global financial contagion than remote Pacific
- **Political instability:** Ecuador and El Salvador have experienced political upheaval; Panama more stable
- **Security:** Urban crime higher than remote islands; piracy risk in some coastal areas
- **Cyclone risk:** Eastern Pacific and Caribbean have hurricane seasons; need safe refuge or haul-out

**Example locations:**

- **Ecuador:** Galpagos (pristine but expensive, permit required), mainland coast (Santa Cruz, Salinas)
- **El Salvador:** Limited cruising infrastructure; Caribbean coast
- **Panama:** San Blas Islands (Kuna Yala - beautiful, indigenous autonomy, limited services), Bocas del Toro (Caribbean), Panama Canal zone (services), Las Perlas Islands (Pacific)

**Region 3: Countries That Weathered 2008 Crisis Well (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Chile)**

**Why suitable:**

These nations demonstrated economic resilience through strong pre-crisis fiscal positions, well-regulated banking systems, and effective use of monetary/fiscal policy. They avoided the worst of the 2008 collapse and recovered faster than most advanced economies. Sound fiscal management, commodity exports (especially food), and flexible exchange rates contributed to stability.

**Specific advantages for economic collapse:**

- **Economic management:** Proven track record of navigating global crises
- **Currency stability:** CAD, AUD, NZD, Chilean peso generally stable
- **Rule of law:** Strong institutions protect property rights
- **Modern infrastructure:** Excellent medical, education, communications
- **Food security:** All are food exporters (insulated from global supply chain breakdown)

**Risks and considerations:**

- **Visa restrictions:** Work permits and long-stay visas often difficult; may be limited to tourist visas (3-6 months)
- **Cost:** High cost of living (especially New Zealand, Australia)
- **Weather:** New Zealand and southern Chile have challenging weather; Canada cold
- **Distance:** Australia and New Zealand remote from Americas (long passages)
- **Global exposure:** Still connected to global economy (less insulated than subsistence regions)

**Example locations:**

- **Canada:** Pacific Northwest (Vancouver Island, Desolation Sound - summer only)
- **Australia:** Great Barrier Reef, Whitsundays, Tasmania (varied climates, excellent cruising)
- **New Zealand:** Bay of Islands, Marlborough Sounds, Fiordland (world-class cruising, cyclone-free)
- **Chile:** Patagonia (Puerto Montt to Cape Horn - stunning, remote, cold but safe from cyclones)

### Destinations to Avoid

**Major urban ports in collapsing economies:**

- **Why:** Violence, looting, piracy increase; marinas may be unsafe; supplies unavailable; exit restrictions may be imposed
- **Examples:** Venezuelan ports, major cities in economically unstable countries

**Coastal areas immediately adjacent to collapsed economies:**

- **Why:** Piracy risk (cash-starved fishermen turn to piracy); refugee flows; violence spills across borders
- **Examples:** Caribbean waters near Venezuela, Central American coasts during regional instability

**Countries with capital controls or asset confiscation history:**

- **Why:** Risk of trapped assets, forced currency conversion at unfavorable rates, exit restrictions
- **Examples:** Argentina (history of corralito), Venezuela, Zimbabwe

**High-cyclone/hurricane risk areas during storm season without adequate protection:**

- **Why:** Cannot afford to lose vessel (only home and means of escape); haul-out may be unavailable/unaffordable
- **Examples:** Caribbean June-November, South Pacific November-April (except French Polynesia Marquesas)

**Countries hostile to foreign vessels or with confiscation risk:**

- **Why:** Government desperate for revenue may seize foreign assets
- **Examples:** Varies; monitor US State Department advisories
