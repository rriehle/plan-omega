# Economic Collapse Scenarios: Maritime Survival Research Report

**Report Date:** 2025-10-23
**Prepared for:** Plan Omega - Maritime Family Survival Manual
**Research Focus:** Economic collapse scenarios, historical examples, and maritime-specific survival strategies

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research report examines major economic collapses throughout history and identifies specific survival advantages for families living aboard sailing vessels. Key findings demonstrate that maritime mobility, fishing capability, and access to dollarized economies provide significant survival advantages during currency crises, hyperinflation, and economic depressions.

**Critical Insight:** Historical evidence shows those with mobility, tangible skills, and access to multiple currencies/economies fared significantly better during economic collapses than those trapped in single locations with fixed incomes.

## 1. HISTORICAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSES: CASE STUDIES

### 1.1 The Great Depression (1929-1941, USA)

**Duration:** 12 years (1929-1941)
**Severity:** Unemployment reached 25%; GDP fell by 30%

#### Key Survival Strategies That Worked

**Mobility Advantages:**

- Families traveled to wherever work happened to be, with 20,000-200,000 people migrating westward from Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, and Arkansas
- Those with vehicles used them as mobile shelters, saving money while staying mobile enough to chase employment opportunities or flee famine areas
- Mobility allowed families to escape areas under severe famine or economic collapse

**Successful Tactics:**

- **Family unity:** Families stuck together; attitude and persistence were keys to survival
- **Adaptability:** Took whatever work available, any jobs that could be found
- **Bartering:** Payment often made with eggs, fresh milk, or produce; bartering allowed families to diversify their food sources
- **Self-sufficiency:** Community and backyard gardens were necessities; families grew, canned, dehydrated, pickled, and jarred their own produce
- **Resourcefulness:** "Use it up, wear it out, make do or do without" - Americans repaired items themselves rather than replacing them

**Who Suffered Most:**

- Those with fixed incomes and no mobility
- Urban workers dependent on industrial employment
- Those without practical skills or ability to produce goods

**Maritime Lesson:** Mobility + self-sufficiency + practical skills = survival advantage

### 1.2 Weimar Germany Hyperinflation (1923)

**Timeline:** Peak in November 1923
**Severity:** Currency went from 1:1 to 4.2 trillion marks to 1 USD

#### What Worked

**Barter Systems:**

- Germans abandoned money altogether and began bartering to obtain necessities
- Coal and sausages were used as currency
- **Cigarette currency:** Cigarettes became commodity money - easily divisible and internationally acceptable, they could buy goods that paper marks could not

**Farming and Food Production:**

- Farmers thrived by selling goods at constantly increasing prices
- They quickly converted near-worthless currency into tangible assets: equipment, real estate, or debt repayment
- Having access to land and ability to produce essential goods like food provided stability and leverage
- Stories of farmers buying grand pianos and luxury items from desperate urbanites

**Property and Tangible Assets:**

- Those whose wealth took the form of property escaped the worst
- Those with goods or skills that could be readily bartered survived
- Farmers produced their own essentials, could barter locally, and could raise prices as needed

**Debt Strategies:**

- Those with large debts benefited enormously - debts could be easily repaid with worthless currency
- Clever businessmen borrowed early in the inflationary cycle to buy property, then repaid loans weeks later for next to nothing

**Immediate Spending:**

- People rushed to spend money immediately rather than save, desperate to exchange money for something real
- Foreign currencies became preferred over local currency

#### Who Suffered Most

- Cash savers, particularly the middle class
- People on fixed incomes and pensions - savings completely wiped out
- Urban workers without tangible skills

**Peak Impact:** At the worst point, one loaf of bread cost 200 billion marks

**Maritime Lesson:** Tangible assets, food production capability, and access to foreign currencies = survival

---

### 1.3 Zimbabwe Hyperinflation (2007-2009)

**Timeline:** Peak in November 2008
**Severity:** 89.7 sextillion percent annual inflation; unemployment ~80%

#### Survival Strategies

**Switching to Foreign Currency:**

- Citizens increasingly used foreign currency in daily exchanges
- Local shops priced goods in foreign currency (primarily USD) because they needed it to import goods
- Businesses switched to US dollars as the only way to survive inflation

**Barter Economy:**

- People paid for goods in kind (e.g., using agricultural produce to get a haircut)
- **Limitation:** Barter only useful if you have goods to exchange

**Currency Trading:**

- Currency trading became one of the largest employers
- Tens of thousands saw it as the only viable source of income
- Many in currency trade made enough money to buy houses, vehicles, and start businesses

**Immediate Spending:**

- People had to spend or exchange Zimbabwean currency as soon as they received it

#### Official Dollarization (2009)

- January 2009: Government lifted restriction on using only Zimbabwean dollars
- Citizens allowed to use US dollar, euro, and South African rand
- **Impact:** Stabilized prices, exchange rates, and rebuilt confidence in currency value
- Government stopped printing Zimbabwean dollars, restored consumer confidence

#### Hardships

- Even with salaries in the trillions per month, this amounted to around $1 USD
- Unemployment rate close to 80%
- Virtual breakdown in normal economic activity

**Maritime Lesson:** Access to foreign (hard) currencies essential; ability to produce tradeable goods critical

---

### 1.4 Venezuela Crisis (2015-Present)

**Timeline:** Ongoing since 2015
**Severity:** Worst economic crisis in Venezuela's history; GDP shrunk by >75%; 8 million fled (85% to other Latin American countries)

#### Survival Strategies

**Barter Systems:**

- Workers often paid in goods or barter, not cash
- Savings wiped out
- Venezuelans spent years bartering, lining up for hours outside supermarkets, or fighting in streets for flour, rice, bread, or other food

**Fishing as Income:**

- Fishermen in coastal areas had reliable source of income, however unreliable
- Access to fishing resources provided survival advantage over urban populations

**Dollarization (Informal, then Formal):**

- Venezuelans emerged from COVID-19 pandemic to fully stocked stores with US dollar as dominant currency for everyday transactions
- Economy remains unstable with key oil revenue drying up due to renewed sanctions

#### Security Threats

**Piracy and Maritime Violence:**

- Political and economic crisis propelled cash-starved fishermen into smuggling and piracy
- Risk of pirates in Caribbean expected to grow for cruisers and cargo ships
- **April 2020 example:** Canadian-flagged yacht heading to Colombia from Honduras accosted by 25 pirates in four boats who stole electronics and diving equipment
- Venezuelan Navy patrol vessel sank after ramming cruise liner (desperate times)
- Failing economy, crumbling infrastructure, and limited government reach left small fishing villages as havens for smugglers and pirates

**Violence and Looting:**

- **2015:** 56 incidents of looting and 76 looting attempts in first half of year
- **2016:** 170 lootings or attempted lootings from January to April
- Desperate economic circumstances caused surge in extreme poverty and violent crime
- One man killed and 60 arrested in Ciudad Guayana after shops looted

**Migration Drivers:**

- UN identified main drivers: widespread crime, inflation, shortages of food, medicine, and essential services
- 7.7 million people fled since 2014

**Maritime Lesson:** Economic collapse can create piracy/maritime security threats; coastal areas may become dangerous; get out early

---

### 1.5 Argentina Crisis (2001-2002)

**Timeline:** Crisis deepened 1998-2001; collapse December 2001
**Severity:** Unemployment 23%; 50% below poverty line; 25% indigent; 40,000 companies shut down since 1998

#### The "Corralito" (Banking Freeze)

- **December 2, 2001:** Government enacted "corralito" - limited cash withdrawals to $250/week initially
- Name "El Corralito" now used globally to describe similar banking freezes
- Provoked strikes, protests, widespread civil unrest, and looting

#### Currency Devaluation Impact

- **Pre-crisis:** Convertibility regime maintained 1 peso = 1 USD
- **January 6, 2002:** Government terminated convertibility
- **Result:** Peso lost nearly 70% of value within months

**Advantage for Dollar Holders:**

- Those holding $1,000 in pesos saw value reduced to ~$300 or less
- Those holding actual USD maintained purchasing power; wealth increased relative to peso holders
- By September 2001, >70% of banking liabilities were dollar-denominated
- By end of 2001, Argentine banking system lacked dollar reserves to back dollar deposits

#### Survival Strategies

**Grassroots Barter Networks (Redes de Trueque):**

- Sprang up to help people cope
- People offered whatever they had: repairing washing machine for six eggs, doing accounts for car repairs
- Networks spread throughout Greater Buenos Aires
- Networks began issuing their own currencies

**Loss of Savings:**

- Corralito and devaluation wiped out most life savings
- Example: One depositor lost $40,000 out of $77,000 in bank deposits

#### Who Escaped

- Those who moved money abroad before crisis
- Those who held physical US dollars
- Those who emigrated to functioning economies

**Maritime Lesson:** Hold hard currency; don't trust banks in unstable economies; mobility = escape option

---

### 1.6 Soviet Union Collapse (1991)

**Timeline:** Dissolution December 1991
**Post-collapse severity:** 25% of population below poverty line; life expectancy fell; sharp increase in economic inequality

#### Who Thrived

- Political leaders who built coalitions and adapted to changing circumstances
- Those with international connections and mobility
- Regional variations: Those who combined nationalist, democratic, and worker alliances (Ukraine model)

#### Economic Impact

- 40% contraction in per capita GDP from 2013-2017 (some regions)
- Those with flexibility and ability to navigate changing political landscape fared better
- Mobility and international connections provided advantages

**Maritime Lesson:** Political collapse often accompanies economic collapse; international mobility invaluable

## 2. ECONOMIC COLLAPSE CHARACTERISTICS

### 2.1 Warning Signs and Indicators

#### Primary Warning Indicators (12-24 months advance notice)

**Inverted Yield Curve:**

- Most closely watched predictor
- When short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates
- Historical accuracy: 12-24 months before recession

**Rising Unemployment Claims:**

- Sustained increase in initial jobless claims
- Rising by 20-25% from cyclical low = early warning
- **Sahm Rule:** Recession identified when 3-month moving average of unemployment rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to previous 12-month low

**Asset Bubbles:**

- First sign of crisis often an asset bubble
- Examples: Housing prices (2008), stock market (1929, 2001)

**Credit Expansion:**

- Vast majority of crises follow periods of rapid credit expansion
- Key factor: Credit expands much faster than economy

#### Additional Warning Indicators

- Manufacturing surveys declining
- Housing starts and home sales dropping sharply
- Consumer confidence measures falling
- Credit application trends slowing
- Declining GDP growth

**Expert Recommendation:** Look for confluence of warning signs, not single indicators

### 2.2 Types of Economic Collapse

#### Currency Failure vs. Hyperinflation vs. Deflation

**Hyperinflation:**

- **Definition:** Prices rise >50% per month
- **Mechanism:** Deterioration of monetary base and confidence in currency's store of value
- **Characteristics:**
  - Increased prices, devalued currency
  - More bankruptcies, less purchasing power
  - Shortages of goods like food
  - Currency value plummets in foreign exchange markets
  - Unemployment rises
  - Government struggles to provide basic services
- **Primary cause:** Uncontrolled budgetary deficits financed by money creation
- **Examples:** Zimbabwe (89.7 sextillion % in Nov 2008), Weimar Germany, Venezuela

**Deflation:**

- **Definition:** Inflation rate falls below 0%; prices decrease
- **Mechanism:** Increase in real value of monetary unit
- **Characteristics:**
  - Decreased spending (waiting for lower prices)
  - Rising inventories, job losses, decreasing GDP
  - Increases real value of debt
  - Feedback loop: Prices fall -> people don't buy -> prices fall more
  - Creates economic paralysis
- **Historical impact:** Great Depression - sustained deflation deepened collapse and prolonged recovery
- **Note:** Economists attribute Hitler's rise to 1929 deflation/Depression, not 1923 hyperinflation

**Currency Failure:**

- **Definition:** Complete breakdown of confidence in monetary system
- **Progression:** Value can drop from 1:1 to 50:1 to 2,000:1 in successive months
- **International impact:** Stable economies refuse to trade with unstable economies; investors and trade partners abandon currency
- **Result:** Typically follows extreme hyperinflation

**Key Distinction:** Hyperinflation and deflation are opposite directional movements, yet both lead to economic collapse through different mechanisms. Both create instability where people can't predict future costs.

### 2.3 Supply Chain Breakdown Patterns

#### Critical Infrastructure Priority

**Strategic Super Sectors (require sustainment):**

- Transportation
- Warehousing
- Utilities (electricity, water)

**Failure Impact:** Exacerbates crisis states, compounds crises, worsens crisis management by triggering production downtimes and socio-economic/environmental damages

#### Specific Vulnerabilities

**Fuel and Energy:**

- Demands may emerge transiently in fuel panic
- **Example:** Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack disrupted 50% of fuel supply to US East Coast, causing panic buying and shortages
- **Lebanese crisis:** Led to fuel shortages for electricity plants, resulting in 2021 blackout - public utilities offered power only a few hours per day

**Cascading Effects:**

- Unstable supply chain breeds vulnerability for consumers, workers, businesses, and economy
- Disruptions create cascading failures rather than simple sequential order
- Sequence depends on nature and cause of particular crisis

**No Definitive Order:** Research indicates which services fail first depends on the specific crisis type, but fuel/energy and utilities are typically among earliest casualties.

### 2.4 Duration of Economic Collapses

#### Recessions

**Average Duration:**

- 11 recessions between 1945-2001: average 10 months
- Last 100 years: average 14 months
- 1854-1919: average 22 months (modern recessions are shorter)

**Range:**

- **Shortest:** COVID-19 recession (2020): 2 months
- **Longest recent:** 2008 financial crisis: 18 months

**Average Expansion:** 47 months (normal state of economy; most recessions are brief)

#### Depressions vs. Recessions

**Depressions:**

- More prolonged and severe than recessions
- May last many years
- **Great Depression:** 1929-1941 (12 years)

#### Recovery Timeline

- Expansion is normal state; most recessions are brief
- **However:** Time to return to previous peak activity or trend path may be quite extended
- **Research finding:** Each additional year of economic boom delays following recovery by ~2.5 months
- **Financial crises:** Recessions related to financial market problems tend to be more severe and persistent than average recessions

**Key Takeaway:** While recessions average 10-18 months, recovery to pre-crisis levels can take much longer, especially after financial crises or depressions.

## 3. MARITIME ADVANTAGES DURING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE

### 3.1 Why Living on a Boat is Advantageous

#### Economic Advantages

**Reduced Fixed Costs:**

- Avoid property taxes
- Eliminate home ownership expenses
- Particularly advantageous in high-cost areas
- Can be much less expensive than house (though marina fees, maintenance, insurance must be conservatively estimated)

**Energy Independence:**

- Sailboats rely primarily on wind power, reducing fuel costs
- Harnessing wind power reduces fuel dependency significantly
- Cost-effective for long-term living

**Self-Sufficiency Technologies:**

- Renewable energy: Solar panels, wind turbines
- Watermakers reduce reliance on shore facilities
- Greater energy self-sufficiency enables extended stays in remote areas

#### Mobility - The Critical Advantage

**Freedom to Relocate:**

- Lift anchor and move your home whenever needed
- Sail to different countries and cities while maintaining home comforts
- Change location to discover new landscapes and economic opportunities
- **Historical precedent:** During Great Depression and Argentina crisis, those with mobility could chase work or flee collapsed areas

**Access to Multiple Economies:**

- Not trapped in single failing economy
- Can relocate to functioning economies
- Can access dollarized economies or countries with stable currencies

#### Food Independence

**Fishing:**

- Brings you closer to fishing, snorkeling, scuba diving
- Supplement stores to stay in remote anchorages longer
- **Critical advantage:** Can fish when stores are empty or money is worthless
- **Pacific advantage:** Simple squid lure guarantees fish; easy catching and great diving
- **Caribbean reality:** Has become scarce and highly specialized (but fishermen eager to sell to cruisers)

**Foraging:**

- Ability to fish and forage greatly extends time in remote anchorages
- Typically supplements rather than fully sustains food supply
- Long-distance cruisers outfit boats to be comfortable off-grid homes

#### Skills Development

**Practical Skills from Boat Ownership:**

- Navigation, weather prediction, boat maintenance
- Diesel engines, electrical wiring, plumbing
- Small appliance repair, waterproofing, woodwork
- **Value:** These skills remain valuable for barter/trade during collapse

#### Access to Remote Areas

- Can reach locations accessible only by boat
- Examples: Anaho Bay (Marquesas) - no roads, accessible only by boat or on foot/horseback
- Some people live in such areas fishing, farming, running small restaurants for sailors

### 3.2 Maritime Disadvantages/Vulnerabilities

#### Security Threats During Economic Collapse

**Piracy Increase:**

- Venezuela example: Economic crisis propelling cash-starved fishermen into smuggling and piracy
- Caribbean piracy risk expected to grow for cruisers and cargo ships
- Remote areas with failing government reach become havens for smugglers/pirates

**Examples:**

- April 2020: Canadian yacht accosted by 25 pirates in 4 boats (Caribbean)
- Venezuelan Navy desperation - patrol vessel sank after ramming cruise liner

**Vulnerable Periods:**

- Coastal areas near collapsed economies
- Areas with crumbling infrastructure and limited government control
- Small fishing villages that become pirate havens

#### Limited Storage

- Boats have limited space compared to homes
- Must carefully select what to store
- Provisions require planning and rotation

#### Weather Vulnerability

- Cyclone seasons limit safe cruising areas seasonally
- Must plan safe havens or haul-out locations
- Weather can restrict mobility at critical times

#### Maintenance Costs

- Marine equipment expensive
- Salt water corrosive - constant maintenance required
- DIY saves money but requires skills and time
- Economic downturns can reduce access to repair parts/services

## 4. BEST DESTINATIONS DURING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE

### 4.1 Countries with Stable Currencies

#### Dollarized Economies

**Fully Dollarized (adopted USD as legal tender):**

- **Ecuador:** Dollarized 2000 (after major economic crisis)
- **El Salvador:** Dollarized 2001
- **Panama:** Adopted USD after independence

**Highly Dollarized:**

- **Cambodia:** All sizable transactions paid in USD

**Benefits:**

- Assures country will import stable prices and lower interest rates from United States
- Reduces risk, protects against inflation and devaluation
- Creates more stable capital market
- Ends sudden capital outflows

**Drawbacks:**

- Country gives up monetary policy and exchange rate as policy instruments

**Research Finding:** Little evidence that high dollarization heightens probability of banking crises or currency crashes; no robust evidence that they are more costly in highly dollarized countries

#### Safe Haven Currencies

**Traditional Safe Havens:**

- Swiss franc
- Japanese yen
- US dollar (dominant economic position and widespread use in global trade make it preferred)

**Strategy:** Few in developing nations trust their currencies; wealthy seek safe havens in these currencies

### 4.2 Subsistence Economies

#### Characteristics

- Less dependent on global finance
- Less integrated with global economy
- Can be somewhat insulated from crisis's worst effects due to limited financial and trade linkages

#### 2008 Crisis Example

- Poor countries mainly unintegrated with global economy were less affected
- Trade is medium through which financial contagion spreads
- Those exporting food appear to have fared better
- Share of commodities (food and overall) in exports associated with smaller downward growth revisions

### 4.3 Countries That Weathered 2008 Crisis Well

#### Emerging Markets and Developing Economies

- Weathered global recession relatively well
- Used sizable fiscal and monetary policy ammunition accumulated during prior years of strong growth
- **Strong performers:** Brazil, China, India helped mitigate deflationary risks and avoid Great Depression repetition

#### Key Success Factors

**Pre-crisis Fiscal Position:**

- Countries with stronger pre-crisis fiscal positions experienced smaller losses
- Those in better fiscal shape suffered less damage

**Financial Regulation:**

- Better regulated and supervised banks = less damage
- Flexible exchange rate regimes experienced smaller losses

**Trade Composition:**

- Commodity exporters (especially food) fared better
- Food exporters particularly resilient

**Limited Integration:**

- Less integrated economies somewhat insulated
- Limited financial and trade linkages provided protection

#### Who Suffered Most

- Advanced economies hit harder
- Commodity-exporting low income developing countries hit harder
- Countries with high exposure to international trade

### 4.4 Barter-Friendly Cultures

#### Characteristics

- Cultures accustomed to informal economy
- Less reliance on formal banking/currency systems
- Strong local community networks
- Agricultural/fishing communities

#### Examples from Collapse Scenarios

**Argentina (2001):**

- Grassroots barter networks (Redes de Trueque) emerged rapidly
- Networks spread throughout Greater Buenos Aires
- Created own currencies
- Cultural acceptance of informal exchange

**Venezuela:**

- Years of experience with barter systems
- Workers paid in goods rather than cash
- Agricultural produce used for services (produce for haircut)

### 4.5 Remote Areas with Local Food Production

#### Pacific Islands - Optimal for Maritime Families

**The Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia):**

- **Cyclone risk:** Zero - never affected by cyclones
- **Location:** 139° West, 10° South
- **Anchorages:** Large number of protected anchorages, particularly north coast
- **Access:** Remote areas accessible only by boat or on foot/horseback
- **Local economy:** People live there fishing, farming, some run small restaurants for sailors
- **Advantage:** Complete food independence possible; fishing abundant; minimal integration with global economy

**Tahiti and Moorea:**

- Protected by coral reef and geographic relief
- **Phaeton Bay (Tahiti):** Good cyclone hole between Tahiti Iti and Tahiti Nui
- Boat watching services available
- More developed but still offers protection

**Cyclone Season Strategy:**

- Nominal South Pacific cyclone season: November-April
- Safe cruising: May-October
- Riskiest months: January-March
- Risk extremely low in French Polynesia, particularly in non-El Nino years

**Pacific vs. Caribbean for Self-Sufficiency:**

- **Pacific fishing:** Far superior - simple squid lure guarantees fish west of Panama
- **Caribbean fishing:** Scarce and highly specialized (less reliable for subsistence)
- **Pacific distances:** Islands thousands of miles apart (more isolation from contagion)
- **Caribbean distances:** Islands only daysail apart (easier mobility but more exposure)

#### Other Considerations

**Remote Fishing Villages:**

- Communities with strong local food production
- Minimal dependence on imported goods
- May welcome sailors with valuable skills/goods for trade
- Access to fresh fish, local agriculture

**Caution:** During severe economic collapse, even remote areas may become piracy havens (Venezuela example)

## 5. SURVIVAL STRATEGIES SPECIFIC TO ECONOMIC COLLAPSE

### 5.1 Barter Economy Participation

#### Most Valuable Goods for Trade

**Consumables and Addictive Items (High Value):**

- **Cigarettes:** Historical precedent as commodity money (Weimar Germany)
  - Easily divisible
  - Internationally acceptable
  - Could buy goods that currency couldn't
- **Alcohol:** Value increases dramatically during crisis
- **Coffee:** High demand luxury
- **Razors, underwear:** Basic necessities maintain value
- **Medicines:** Critical and high-value
- **Candy:** Luxury item with value
- **Batteries:** Essential for electronics

**Basic Necessities:**

- **Food:** Shortages create extreme demand; excess food has huge trade impact
- **Clean drinking water capability:** Vital - ability to provide clean water extremely valuable
- **Fuel:** Always in demand
- **Soap, hygiene products:** Maintain value

**Durable Goods:**

- **Tools:** Maintain value, enable production
- **Fishing gear:** Particularly valuable in maritime context
- **Repair parts:** For common equipment

#### Barter Reality Check

**From SHTF School:** "Barter only useful if you have goods to exchange"

- Need renewable production capability, not just stored goods
- Skills create infinite renewable "goods"
- Food production (fishing, farming) = renewable barter capability

### 5.2 Skills That Remain Valuable

#### Universal High-Value Skills

**Medical Skills:**

- **Highest value:** Medical skills create opportunities for trade in long run
- Cannot "spend" your skills - they remain valuable
- Doctors, nurses, dentists, midwives
- First aid, herbal medicine, emergency care
- **Note:** Despite global shortages, specific barter information limited in research

**Food Production:**

- Gardening, farming
- **Fishing:** Particularly valuable for maritime families
- Food preservation (canning, dehydrating, pickling, jarring)
- Hunting, foraging

**Practical Repair Skills:**

- Shoe repairing (Great Depression example)
- Clothes making/mending
- Small appliance repair
- **Example:** During Great Depression, one person gave haircuts and received cash and goods from regular clientele

#### Maritime-Specific Valuable Skills

**Boat Repair and Maintenance:**

- Marine service sector "anchor that's held it all together in terms of jobs" through multiple recessions
- Diesel engine repair
- Electrical wiring (12V and shore power systems)
- Plumbing and watermaker maintenance
- Fiberglass and gelcoat repair
- Sail repair
- Rigging work
- Canvas and upholstery work

**Navigation and Seamanship:**

- Navigation training
- Weather routing
- Passage planning
- Emergency preparedness at sea

**Other Maritime Skills:**

- Fishing techniques and gear maintenance
- Diving (hull cleaning, repair, salvage)
- Radio operation and repair
- Welding and metal fabrication

**Economic Reality:** Marine service sector remains stable during economic downturns - these skills maintain value

### 5.3 Preserving Wealth

#### Gold and Silver - Historical Evidence

**Weimar Germany Example:**

- Silver climbed from 12 marks/oz to >543 billion marks
- Gold and silver remained globally respected stores of value while local currency became worthless
- People with gold, silver, or foreign currency could still buy food, property, and goods

**Key Advantages:**

- Not tied to any single country's monetary policy (global pricing)
- Tangible assets with intrinsic value
- Liquid and easy to trade in small amounts
- Not dependent on fiat currency stability
- Independent of inflation or economic instability

**Gold vs. Silver Strategy:**

- **Gold:** Wealth preservation (larger value, easier to store significant wealth)
- **Silver:** Everyday transactions ($25-30/oz makes it suitable for smaller transactions)
  - Lower unit value better for groceries, fuel purchases
  - More accessible price point
  - "Spending money" vs. gold's "savings"

**Sound Money Strategy:**

1. Assess individual cost of living requirements
2. Allocate appropriate amounts to gold (preservation)
3. Allocate appropriate amounts to silver (transactions)

**Forms to Hold:**

- **Physical bullion:** Tangible ownership and security
- **Gold-backed ETFs:** Liquidity and convenience (but require functioning financial system)
- Preference for maritime families: Physical metal you control

#### Cryptocurrency - Modern Alternative

**Success Stories:**

- Venezuelan citizens increasingly using Bitcoin and other digital currencies to protect incomes/savings from weakening Bolivar
- **Stablecoins:** Worthy option for investment and asset protection in countries experiencing hyperinflation

**Advantages:**

- Can cross borders easily (not physical)
- Not controlled by failing government
- Can be accessed remotely
- Borderless transactions

**Significant Risks:**

- Highly volatile and speculative
- Lacks FDIC insurance - no protection like traditional bank deposits
- Requires internet/electricity access
- Complex to secure properly (keys, wallets, backups)
- Not universally accepted
- Regulatory uncertainty

**Maritime Consideration:** Requires reliable internet access - may be impractical in remote anchorages

#### Other Tangible Assets

**Real Estate and Land:**

- Can hold value during hyperinflation
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Not quickly sold
  - Can't divide into smaller pieces easily
  - Not compatible with maritime mobility strategy

**Foreign Currency (Hard Currency):**

- **Historical precedent:**
  - Argentina 2001: Those with USD maintained purchasing power while peso lost 70% value
  - Zimbabwe: Informal dollarization enabled survival; USD, euro, South African rand
  - Venezuela: USD became dominant transaction currency
- **Advantages:**
  - Immediate usability
  - Widely recognized
  - Easy to divide for transactions
- **Best currencies:** USD, Swiss franc, euro
- **Strategy for maritime families:** Hold multiple currencies; prioritize USD

**Commodities:**

- Non-perishable food stocks
- Fuel (diesel, gasoline - maritime families need this)
- Medicine
- Tools and equipment

### 5.4 When to Use Cash vs. Goods vs. Services

#### Cash (Local Currency)

**Use When:**

- Early stages of crisis (currency still functional)
- Inflation moderate (not yet hyperinflation)
- Formal economy still operating
- Buying from formal businesses

**Stop Using When:**

- Hyperinflation begins (>50%/month)
- Merchants refuse local currency
- Banking system freezes (corralito scenario)
- Better to hold goods than cash

#### Cash (Foreign/Hard Currency)

**Use When:**

- Local currency failing
- Hyperinflation scenario
- Merchants preferring hard currency
- Making large purchases
- Need to preserve wealth

**Preserve When:**

- Can use goods/services instead
- Building reserve for emergency
- Unsure of future purchasing power

**Best Currencies to Hold:** USD, Swiss franc, euro

#### Goods (Barter)

**Use When:**

- Currency hyperinflating or failed
- Banking system frozen
- Merchants won't accept local currency
- Foreign currency too valuable for small transactions
- Building relationships in community

**Most Tradeable:**

- Cigarettes, alcohol (high value density)
- Food (always needed)
- Fuel (maritime: diesel critical)
- Medicine
- Tools, repair parts

#### Services (Skills/Labor)

**Use When:**

- Goods running low
- Want to preserve stored goods
- Building long-term community relationships
- Services more valuable than goods you have

**High-Value Services:**

- Medical care
- Boat repair (maritime context)
- Teaching
- Navigation/seamanship training
- Fishing instruction

**Strategy:** Services are renewable - you can't "spend" your skills, making them infinitely valuable

### 5.5 Provisioning When Stores Empty but Money Worthless

#### Before Stores Empty (Early Warning Phase)

**Convert Currency to Goods Immediately:**

- Weimar/Zimbabwe lesson: Spend or convert currency as soon as received
- Buy non-perishable provisions
- Stock up on high-value barter goods (cigarettes, alcohol, coffee)
- Fuel (fill all tanks, jerry cans)
- Medicine and first aid supplies
- Boat parts and critical spares

**Prioritize:**

1. Critical medicines and medical supplies
2. Long-term food storage (canned goods, dried foods, grains)
3. Water purification supplies
4. Fuel
5. Barter goods
6. Boat maintenance supplies

#### After Stores Empty

**Fishing and Foraging:**

- Pacific islands: Abundant fishing opportunities
- Learn local foraging from island residents
- Supplement dwindling stores to extend time in remote anchorages

**Trade with Local Producers:**

- Farmers, fishermen in remote areas
- Example: Marquesas - people living by fishing, farming
- Trade skills/goods for food

**Skills for Food:**

- Boat repair for fish (local fishermen)
- Medical care for produce (local farmers)
- Teaching for food (local families)
- Navigation training for provisions

**Relocate to Functioning Economy:**

- **Maritime advantage:** Can sail to country where economy still functions
- Target: Dollarized economies, stable countries
- Pacific strategy: Move to more remote, self-sufficient islands
- **Critical:** Move early, before piracy becomes widespread (Venezuela lesson)

**Create Food Independence:**

- Fishing becomes primary food source
- Supplement with foraging
- Trade skills for local produce
- Grow sprouts/microgreens onboard (limited but helpful)

**Network with Cruising Community:**

- Share resources, information
- Collective purchasing power
- Mutual aid and support
- Weather/safety information sharing

## 6. THREATS UNIQUE TO ECONOMIC COLLAPSE

### 6.1 Violence and Looting

#### Characteristics

**Desperation-Driven:**

- People fighting for basic necessities (food, medicine)
- Patience to stand in line or pay black market fees runs out
- Minor melees escalate to major violence

#### Venezuela Examples (Documented Scale)

**2015:**

- 56 incidents of looting
- 76 looting attempts
- First half of year only

**2016:**

- 170 lootings or attempted lootings (January-April only)
- One man killed, 60 arrested in Ciudad Guayana
- Looting became "part of daily landscape"

**Triggers:**

- Delivery trucks arriving with prized products (chicken, milk)
- Supermarkets with any stock
- Stores with basic goods

#### Argentina 2001 Examples

- Corralito provoked strikes and protests
- Protests turned into widespread civil unrest
- Widespread looting throughout Buenos Aires
- 5 presidents in 2 weeks due to civil unrest

#### Progression Pattern

1. **Early:** Peaceful protests, demonstrations
2. **Middle:** Strikes, road blockages
3. **Late:** Looting attempts, minor violence
4. **Severe:** Widespread looting, major violence, breakdown of order

#### Maritime Implications

**Coastal Areas:**

- Marinas may become targets if seen as wealthy
- Shore access becomes dangerous
- Provisioning requires caution or avoiding shore entirely

**Defense Strategies:**

- Move to remote anchorages early
- Avoid major cities
- Anchor far from shore in areas requiring dinghy access (makes looting difficult)
- Community cruiser anchorages (safety in numbers)
- Relocate to more stable countries early

### 6.2 Government Confiscation

#### Historical Examples of Asset Confiscation

**United States (1933) - Executive Order 6102:**

- Required citizens to surrender most privately-held gold
- Fixed price: $20.67/oz
- After collection, government revalued gold to $35/oz (41% dollar devaluation)
- **Penalties for refusal:**
  - $10,000 fine (equivalent to ~$190,000 today)
  - 10 years imprisonment
- Authority to seize gold upheld; gold confiscated from those who refused
- **Purpose:** Enabled government to print more dollars to stimulate economy; shore up exchange rate
- **Duration:** Long-lasting (many confiscations lasted 13+ years)

**Great Britain:**

- Confiscated gold when not on gold standard
- Lasted until 1979 - full 13 years

**Netherlands (1931):**

- When UK left gold standard, pound devaluation put pressure on guilder
- Imposed variety of restrictions on gold (stopped short of confiscation)

**Australia (1959):**

- Law allowed government to seize gold if "expedient for protection of currency or public credit"
- Never enforced, repealed 1976

#### Common Patterns

**Triggers:**

- Economic crisis where governments abused finances badly
- Eventually nationalized privately held gold from citizens
- Each confiscation arose from crisis situation

**Duration:**

- These confiscations lasted LONG time
- Shortest from advanced economies: 13 years
- US gold confiscation: 1933-1974 (41 years)

#### Modern Risks

**Cash Reporting Requirements:**

- Purchase of car, boat, jewelry with multiple cashier's checks totaling >$10,000 = reportable transaction
- Creates government awareness of assets

**Banking System Control:**

- Argentina corralito: $250/week withdrawal limit
- Cyprus (2013): Bail-in took depositor funds
- **Pattern:** Banking freezes common in severe crises

#### Maritime Assets - Risk Assessment

**Boats:**

- No historical precedent for mass boat confiscation found in research
- **However:** High-value, visible, registered assets
- Could be subject to:
  - Exit restrictions (can't leave territorial waters)
  - Registration/documentation seizure
  - Asset freezes
  - Taxation/fees (confiscatory)

**Gold/Silver on Board:**

- Subject to same confiscation risks as land-based
- **Advantage:** Mobile - can leave jurisdiction
- **Risk:** Searches at departure, customs

**Foreign Bank Accounts:**

- Can be frozen or confiscated
- FATCA/CRS reporting makes hiding difficult
- **Better than:** Domestic accounts in failing country

#### Protection Strategies

**Mobility:**

- **Critical advantage:** Can leave jurisdiction before confiscation
- Historical lesson: Those who left early with assets intact fared best

**Diversification:**

- Multiple currencies (not just one)
- Mix of gold, silver, hard currency
- Some cryptocurrency (despite risks)
- Assets in multiple jurisdictions

**Timing:**

- **Leave early:** Before exit controls imposed
- **Monitor:** Capital controls, banking restrictions = warning signs
- Venezuela, Argentina: Exit controls came suddenly

**Legal Structure:**

- Foreign LLC ownership of boat (complicates confiscation)
- Assets held in multiple names/entities
- **Caution:** Legal complexity vs. practical mobility

### 6.3 Inflation Eating Savings

#### Mechanism

**Hyperinflation Impact:**

- Savings lose value faster than they can be spent
- Zimbabwe: Trillions per month salary = $1 USD
- Weimar: Mark went from 1:1 to 4.2 trillion:1

**Who Suffers Most:**

- Fixed income pensioners (Weimar: completely wiped out)
- Middle class savers (life savings destroyed)
- Those holding cash in local currency
- Bank depositors (when combined with banking freeze)

#### Historical Examples

**Weimar Germany:**

- Main losers: Cash savers, middle class, fixed incomes, pensioners
- Savings completely wiped out
- One loaf of bread: 200 billion marks

**Zimbabwe:**

- Unemployment ~80%
- Salaries in trillions = $1 USD
- Savings wiped out
- Virtual breakdown of economic activity

**Venezuela:**

- Inflation >2,000% into hyperinflation
- Workers paid in goods, not cash
- Savings wiped out

**Argentina:**

- Peso lost 70% value in months
- $1,000 in pesos -> $300 value
- Life savings wiped out (example: $77,000 -> $37,000)
- Corralito prevented access to remaining funds

#### Maritime Family Protection

**Don't Hold Local Currency Savings:**

- Convert immediately to hard assets
- Hold only enough local currency for immediate needs
- Spend or convert as soon as received (Weimar/Zimbabwe lesson)

**Store Wealth in:**

- Hard foreign currencies (USD, Swiss franc, euro)
- Gold/silver (physical, on boat)
- Provisioned goods on boat (diesel, food, parts)
- Tools and equipment (maintain value)

**Avoid:**

- Local currency bank accounts
- Fixed-income investments in local currency
- Pensions in local currency (if possible to avoid)
- Long-term local currency obligations

### 6.4 Unable to Buy Critical Supplies (Even with Money)

#### The Paradox

**Money Becomes Useless When:**

- Shelves empty due to supply chain breakdown
- Merchants refuse local currency (hyperinflation)
- Banks frozen (corralito - can't access money)
- Imports stopped (foreign suppliers won't accept currency)

#### Historical Examples

**Venezuela:**

- Looting for flour, rice, bread
- Fighting in streets for basic food items
- Years of lining up for hours outside supermarkets
- Minor melees when delivery trucks arrived with prized products

**Argentina:**

- $250/week withdrawal limit (corralito)
- Even with money in bank, couldn't access it
- Even with cash, imports stopped

**Zimbabwe:**

- Shops stated prices in foreign currency
- Needed foreign currency to import goods
- Local currency not accepted even when available

#### Supply Chain Breakdown

**Which Services Fail First:**

- Research shows no definitive order (depends on crisis type)
- Typically affected early: Fuel/energy, utilities
- **Lebanon example:** Fuel shortages -> electricity only few hours/day
- **Colonial Pipeline:** 50% of US East Coast fuel disrupted -> panic buying

**Cascading Failures:**

- Fuel shortage -> transportation stops
- Transportation stops -> food deliveries stop
- Power shortages -> refrigeration fails -> food spoils
- Imports require foreign currency -> local currency rejected -> no imports

#### Maritime Family Solutions

**Pre-Crisis Preparation:**

- Heavily provision boat (6-12 months supplies)
- Critical spares for all systems
- Medical supplies (extensive)
- Fuel (fill all tanks before crisis)
- Water (tankage + watermaker + backups)

**During Crisis:**

- **Fishing:** Independent food source when stores empty
- **Foraging:** Supplement from local environment (Pacific islands)
- **Trade skills:** For food/supplies from locals
- **Relocate:** Sail to functioning economy

**Critical Supplies for Maritime:**

1. **Diesel fuel:** Can't sail without it (even sailboats need engine)
2. **Engine parts:** Impeller, belts, filters, injectors
3. **Watermaker parts:** Membranes, pumps
4. **Medical supplies:** Antibiotics, first aid, chronic meds
5. **Communications:** Radio parts, batteries
6. **Safety gear:** Flares, EPIRB batteries, life raft service
7. **Rigging:** Spare halyards, sheets, shackles
8. **Electronics:** GPS, chartplotter, backup handheld units

**The Maritime Advantage:**

- Can stock boat heavily (unlike apartment dwellers)
- Can fish (independent food source)
- Can relocate to where supplies available
- Can access remote areas with local food production

**Timing Critical:**

- Stock up when warning signs appear (inverted yield curve, rising unemployment)
- Don't wait for crisis to hit
- Venezuela/Argentina: Sudden onset after warning period

## 7. SYNTHESIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 7.1 Key Lessons Across All Crises

#### Universal Success Factors

1. **Mobility = Survival Advantage**
   - Great Depression: Families who could travel to work survived better
   - Argentina 2001: Those who could leave (emigrate) protected wealth
   - Venezuela: 8 million fled (escape option saved them)
   - Soviet collapse: Those with international connections thrived
   - **Maritime application:** Sailing vessel provides ultimate mobility

2. **Hard Currency > Local Currency**
   - Argentina: USD holders maintained wealth; peso holders lost 70%
   - Zimbabwe: USD/euro/rand enabled survival during hyperinflation
   - Venezuela: USD became dominant currency
   - Weimar: Foreign currency could buy food when marks couldn't
   - **Maritime application:** Easy to hold multiple currencies on boat

3. **Tangible Assets > Paper Assets**
   - Weimar: Property owners survived; cash savers wiped out
   - All crises: Gold/silver maintained value
   - Great Depression: Those producing goods (farmers) thrived
   - **Maritime application:** Boat itself is tangible, mobile asset

4. **Food Independence = Security**
   - Great Depression: Gardens and food production critical
   - Weimar: Farmers thrived while urban populations starved
   - All crises: Those who could produce food had leverage
   - **Maritime application:** Fishing provides renewable food source

5. **Skills > Stored Goods**
   - Great Depression: Haircuts, repairs for barter
   - Argentina: Barter networks based on services
   - Universal: Medical, repair, production skills always valuable
   - **Maritime application:** Boat repair skills highly valuable; can't "spend" skills

6. **Early Action > Late Reaction**
   - All crises: Those who acted on warning signs fared better
   - Confiscations: Those who moved assets early avoided loss
   - Violence: Those who left early avoided danger
   - **Maritime application:** Can depart early when warning signs appear

7. **Community > Isolation**
   - Great Depression: Family unity key to survival
   - Argentina: Grassroots barter networks emerged
   - Cruising community: Information sharing, mutual aid
   - **Maritime application:** Cruiser networks provide support, safety, information

#### Universal Failure Patterns

1. **Fixed location = Trapped**
   - Urban workers in failing cities struggled most
   - Those who couldn't relocate suffered more
   - Coastal areas near collapsed economies became dangerous

2. **Paper wealth = Destroyed**
   - Bank accounts frozen (corralito)
   - Savings wiped out by hyperinflation
   - Pensions in local currency worthless

3. **Dependence on system = Vulnerability**
   - Fixed incomes failed
   - Government services collapsed
   - Supply chains broke
   - Banking systems froze

### 7.2 Optimal Strategy for Maritime Family

#### Phase 1: Monitoring (Pre-Crisis)

**Warning Sign Monitoring:**

- Inverted yield curve (12-24 month warning)
- Rising unemployment claims (Sahm Rule: +0.5% = recession)
- Asset bubbles forming
- Rapid credit expansion
- Declining manufacturing, housing starts
- Falling consumer confidence

**Preparation Actions:**

- Maintain 6-12 month provisions on boat
- Build hard currency reserves (USD, Swiss franc, euro)
- Acquire physical gold/silver (bias toward silver for transactions)
- Stock critical boat spares
- Develop barter goods inventory (cigarettes, alcohol, coffee, medicines)
- Enhance fishing capabilities and skills
- Build cruiser community network
- Research dollarized economies and stable countries
- Identify safe haven destinations (Marquesas, etc.)

**Financial Positioning:**

- Minimize local currency holdings
- Diversify across multiple hard currencies
- Hold physical precious metals on boat
- Avoid fixed-income local currency investments
- Consider foreign bank accounts (multiple jurisdictions)
- Pay off debts if possible (unless hyperinflation expected - then hold debt)

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Readiness (Warning Signs Appear)

**Immediate Actions:**

- Convert remaining local currency to hard assets
- Fuel up completely (all tanks, all jerry cans)
- Provision heavily (food, water, medicines)
- Purchase critical spares while available
- Stockpile barter goods
- Top off gas bottles (propane/butane)
- Service all critical systems (engine, watermaker, etc.)
- Update charts and navigation equipment
- Prepare to depart on short notice

**Positioning:**

- Move away from major cities
- Position in safe anchorage
- Clear boat of non-essential items (make room for provisions)
- Brief all family members on departure plan

**Financial:**

- Withdraw cash from banks (hard currency if possible)
- Convert all local currency to hard assets or foreign currency
- Ensure critical documents secure and waterproof
- Back up all digital information

#### Phase 3: Departure (Crisis Begins)

**Immediate Departure If:**

- Hyperinflation begins (>50%/month)
- Civil unrest/looting starts
- Government announces capital controls
- Exit restrictions discussed/rumored
- Violence increasing

**Destination Selection:**

- **First choice:** Marquesas (no cyclone risk, abundant fishing, remote, minimal global integration)
- **Second choice:** Other French Polynesia islands with protection
- **Third choice:** Dollarized economies (Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama)
- **Fourth choice:** Countries that weathered 2008 well with good fiscal management
- **Avoid:** Countries with high trade integration, weak fiscal positions, failing currencies

**Route Planning:**

- Avoid coastal areas near collapsed economies (piracy risk)
- Direct route to safe haven
- Provision for longest possible passage (in case of diversions)
- Weather windows secondary to security (accept some weather risk to escape)

#### Phase 4: Safe Haven Operations

**Initial Arrival:**

- Establish secure anchorage
- Connect with local and cruiser community
- Assess local economic conditions
- Identify food sources (fishing, markets, farms)
- Establish barter/trade relationships

**Economic Operations:**

- Use hard currency for major purchases
- Develop barter relationships for daily needs
- Offer skills (boat repair, medical, teaching) for local goods
- Fish to supplement and extend provisions
- Preserve hard currency reserves

**Security:**

- Maintain low profile (don't display wealth)
- Anchor in community of cruisers when possible
- Remote anchorages if security situation deteriorates
- Maintain departure readiness if situation changes

**Long-term Sustainability:**

- Fishing as primary food source
- Trading skills for provisions
- Minimal cash expenditures
- Self-sufficiency in water (watermaker)
- Solar/wind power for energy independence
- Community integration (respectful, generous, contributing)

## CONCLUSIONS

This comprehensive research reveals that maritime families living aboard sailing vessels possess unique and significant advantages during economic collapse scenarios:

### Primary Advantages

1. **Mobility:** Ability to relocate to functioning economies before capital controls or exit restrictions imposed
2. **Food independence:** Fishing provides renewable food source when supply chains fail
3. **Multi-currency access:** Can hold and use hard currencies; can sail to dollarized economies
4. **Tangible asset:** Boat itself is mobile, valuable, tangible asset
5. **Valuable skills:** Boat repair, navigation, fishing skills maintain barter value
6. **Self-sufficiency:** Water, power, shelter independent of failing infrastructure
7. **Community:** Cruising networks provide information, mutual aid, security

### Critical Success Factors

Historical evidence across all studied collapses demonstrates:

- **Early action beats late reaction** - Those who departed before crisis peaked fared best
- **Hard currency beats local currency** - USD/Swiss franc/euro maintained value
- **Skills beat stored goods** - Renewable value vs. one-time use
- **Mobility beats fixed location** - Escape option is invaluable
- **Tangible assets beat paper assets** - Gold, silver, goods held value; bank accounts did not

### Recommended Strategy

For a family of four living aboard a sailing vessel:

1. **Monitor economic indicators** (inverted yield curve = 12-24 month warning)
2. **Maintain heavy provisions** (6-12 months) and critical spares
3. **Hold hard currencies** (USD, Swiss franc, euro) and silver for transactions
4. **Develop fishing and barter skills**
5. **Research safe haven destinations** (Marquesas optimal)
6. **Position for rapid departure** when warning signs intensify
7. **Depart early** - before capital controls, exit restrictions, or violence escalate
8. **Establish in remote, food-independent location** with minimal global economic integration

### The Maritime Advantage

The overwhelming conclusion from this research: A family aboard a well-provisioned sailing vessel with fishing capability, hard currency reserves, valuable skills, and willingness to relocate early possesses superior survival advantages compared to land-based populations during economic collapse scenarios.

The key is recognizing warning signs early and acting decisively before the majority realizes the crisis has begun.
