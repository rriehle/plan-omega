# Part IV: Scenario-Specific Responses

## Overview

Different collapse scenarios require different responses. While Parts I-III provide universal foundations, this section tailors strategies to each specific threat scenario: economic collapse, civil unrest, climate collapse, and war.

## The Four Scenarios

1. **Economic Collapse** - Unemployment, currency failure, supply chain breakdown
2. **Civil Unrest** - Political violence, social breakdown, regional instability
3. **Climate Collapse** - Environmental catastrophe, resource scarcity, habitability loss
4. **War** - Armed conflict, nuclear risk, global instability

## Scenario Characteristics

### Economic Collapse
**Primary challenges**: Access to goods, currency worthlessness, trade disruption
**Best responses**: Barter economy, skilled labor, self-sufficiency, stable havens
**Destinations**: Subsistence economies, local trade networks, isolated communities

### Civil Unrest
**Primary challenges**: Violence, lawlessness, persecution, chaos
**Best responses**: Avoidance, remoteness, low profile, rapid relocation
**Destinations**: Remote anchorages, peaceful cultures, uninhabited areas

### Climate Collapse
**Primary challenges**: Extreme weather, food scarcity, migration, ecosystem failure
**Best responses**: Climate refuges, adaptation, resource management
**Destinations**: High latitudes, stable climates, freshwater availability

### War
**Primary challenges**: Combat zones, nuclear risk, supply disruption, forced conscription
**Best responses**: Neutrality, distance, evasion, survival mode
**Destinations**: Neutral nations, Southern Hemisphere, remote regions

## Multi-Scenario Planning

Scenarios rarely occur in isolation—they cascade and overlap:

**Common cascades:**
- Economic → Civil → War
- Climate → Economic → Civil
- War → Economic → Climate (neglect)

**Implication**: Your plans must address multiple scenarios simultaneously. Identify destinations and strategies that work for several scenarios.
