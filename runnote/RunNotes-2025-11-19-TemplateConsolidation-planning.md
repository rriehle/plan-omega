3. Create template index/catalog
4. Update README files
5. Add template usage guide

**Success Criteria:**

- No duplicate content
- Clear navigation structure
- All references accurate
- Usage documentation complete

### Task 5: Additional Template Integration (Priority 4)

**Objective:** Evaluate and integrate additional templates

**Templates to Consider:**

- Daily Log

- Usage frequency
- Integration complexity
- Value to planning process

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Migration (Day 1)

- Morning: Extract templates from Appendix D
- Afternoon: Replace stubs, test formatting
- Evening: Update cross-references

### Phase 2: Development (Day 2)

- Morning: Develop System Audit Checklist
- Afternoon: Develop Family Emergency Plan Template
- Evening: Review and refine both templates

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Day 3)

- Morning: Remove duplicates from Appendix D
- Afternoon: Create indexes and guides
- Evening: Final testing and validation

## Quality Checkpoints

### After Migration

- [ ] All templates render correctly
- [ ] Links and references work
- [ ] Formatting preserved
- [ ] File sizes appropriate

### After Development

- [ ] Templates comprehensive
- [ ] Usability tested
- [ ] Examples included
- [ ] Instructions clear

### After Cleanup

- [ ] No duplicate content
- [ ] Navigation intuitive
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Version control established

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Data loss during migration**
   - Mitigation: Create backups before changes

2. **Breaking existing references**
   - Mitigation: Document all references first

3. **Template complexity overwhelming users**
   - Mitigation: Include quick-start guides

4. **Version control conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Clear commit messages, atomic changes

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative

- 9 production-ready templates in planning-templates
- 0 placeholder stubs remaining
- 0 duplicate templates
- 100% cross-references updated

### Qualitative

- User can find any template within 30 seconds
- Templates self-explanatory without external documentation
- Clear when to use each template
- Easy to maintain and update

## Notes and Considerations

### Architecture Decision

Need to decide between:

1. **Option A:** All templates in planning-templates directory
2. **Option B:** Keep some in Appendix D with clear references
3. **Option C:** Category-based organization

### Maintenance Process

- Establish template versioning
- Create update schedule
- Define ownership/responsibility
- Document change process

### Integration Points

- Link templates to relevant manual chapters
- Cross-reference with scenarios
- Connect to drill documentation
- Integrate with checklists

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate:** Backup current state
2. **Today:** Begin template extraction from Appendix D
3. **Tomorrow:** Start developing missing templates
4. **This Week:** Complete consolidation and cleanup
5. **Next Week:** User testing and refinement

## Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] All 9 templates production-ready
- [ ] Documentation organization resolved
- [ ] No duplicate content
- [ ] Clear usage guidance
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] Version control established
- [ ] User feedback incorporated
- [ ] Maintenance process defined
