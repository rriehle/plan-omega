## Research Questions

What we need to understand:

1. **Primary**: What knowledge and skills are absolutely essential for a family of four to survive long-term aboard a sailing vessel when shore support is unavailable?
2. **Navigation/Seamanship**: How do we navigate without GPS and handle the vessel in all conditions?
3. **Tools/Repair**: What repair and fabrication skills prevent catastrophic system failures?
4. **Communication**: How do we maintain critical information flow when infrastructure fails?
5. **Integration**: How do we safely interact with and benefit from local communities?
6. **Education**: How do we ensure children's development continues during extended isolation?

## Investigation Approach

Priority order based on CLAUDE.md guidance:
1. Chapter 12: Navigation & Seamanship (HIGHEST PRIORITY - critical for survival)
2. Chapter 14: Tools & Equipment (HIGH - enables maintenance)
3. Chapter 13: Communication (MEDIUM - has redundancy)
4. Chapter 15: Local Integration (MEDIUM - long-term critical)
5. Chapter 11: Education (LOWER - many existing resources)

## Findings Log

### 20:47 - Initial Discovery

Part III chapters (11-15) are all empty. Following CLAUDE.md guidance for priority order:
1. Chapter 12: Navigation & Seamanship (HIGHEST)
2. Chapter 14: Tools & Equipment (HIGH)
3. Chapter 13: Communication (MEDIUM)
4. Chapter 15: Local Integration (MEDIUM)
5. Chapter 11: Education (LOWER)

### 20:50 - Chapter 12 Navigation Research Complete

Comprehensive research completed on maritime navigation and seamanship. Key findings:

**Celestial Navigation**:
- Noon sights ideal starting point (1 nm accuracy for latitude)
- Basic competency: 2-4 months; Full proficiency: 6-12 months
- Essential equipment: Sextant ($700-2000), chronometer, almanac, sight reduction tables
- Lunar distance method provides time backup if chronometer fails

**Non-Electronic Navigation**:
- Dead reckoning accuracy: 5-10% of distance in good conditions
- Lead line depth sounding still viable (traditional markings readable by touch)
- Weather routing possible using barometer, clouds, wind shifts, swells

**Heavy Weather Tactics**:
- No single tactic works for all boats - must practice multiple approaches
- Heaving-to excellent for crew rest but modern fin-keels perform poorly
- Lying ahull most dangerous for monohulls - avoid except last resort
- Storm sails must be set early while deck work still safe

**Learning Timeline**:
- Basic celestial: 2-4 months
- Full celestial: 6-12 months
- General seamanship: 2-3 years (500-1000 hours)
- Heavy weather mastery: 5-10 years offshore

**Priority Skills Order**:
1. Chart plotting and dead reckoning
2. Compass corrections and visual bearings
3. Basic sail trim and helm balance
4. Noon sun sights
5. Anchoring and MOB procedures

### 21:05 - Chapter 14 Tools & Equipment Research Complete

Critical findings from maritime repair and tools research:

**Most Common Failures**:
1. Fuel system (clogged filters, diesel bug) - MOST FREQUENT
2. Cooling system (impeller failures destroy in minutes)
3. Electrical (corrosion/open circuits, not shorts)
4. Rigging (chafe is #1 cause)
5. Through-hulls (50% of sinkings from underwater fittings)

**Essential Skills Priority**:
- Tier 1 (3-6 months): Electrical, diesel, emergency steering
- Tier 2 (6-12 months): Plumbing, sail repair, rigging

**Critical Tools**:
- Fluke 28II multimeter ($600) or BlueSea 8110 ($200)
- West System 105 epoxy (5:1, 50+ year track record)
- Complete offshore kit: $3,350-6,250

**Game-Changing Insights**:
- Dyneema superior to wire rigging for repairability
- 5200 adhesive enables non-sewn sail repairs
- "Unwanted open" most common electrical fault (not shorts)
- Must be able to replace impeller blindfolded
- Each crew member must be able to singlehand boat
