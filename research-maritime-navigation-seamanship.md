# Maritime Navigation and Seamanship Skills for Survival Scenarios

## Executive Summary

This research provides comprehensive guidance on maritime navigation and seamanship skills essential for long-term survival when electronic navigation aids become unavailable. The content emphasizes practical, actionable skills that can be learned and practiced by families preparing for maritime emergency scenarios.

**Key Finding**: Traditional navigation and seamanship skills remain highly relevant and achievable for prepared sailors. Basic celestial navigation proficiency can be attained in days of focused practice, while mastery requires ongoing experience at sea.

## 1. Celestial Navigation

### 1.1 Sun Sights and Noon Positions

#### The Noon Sight: Essential Starting Point

The noon sight is the simplest and most reliable celestial navigation technique, making it the ideal starting point for beginners. This method provides accurate latitude determination without requiring sight reduction tables.

**How It Works**:

- At local noon, the sun reaches its highest point (zenith) in the sky
- Measure the sun's altitude using a sextant at this maximum height
- The time of the observation is not critical for latitude calculation
- Subtract the measured angle from 90 degrees to obtain zenith distance (ZD)
- Look up the sun's declination in the nautical almanac for that date
- Calculate latitude: If you and the sun are in the same hemisphere, subtract declination from ZD; if in different hemispheres, add

**Determining Local Noon**:

*Method 1 - Maximum Altitude*:

- Begin taking sights approximately 10-15 minutes before expected noon
- Continue measuring as the sun climbs
- When the sun stops rising and "hangs" at its highest point for a minute
- Record this maximum reading

*Method 2 - Timing Method*:

- Take a sight approximately 10 minutes before expected noon and record the time
- Without adjusting the sextant, continue taking sights
- When the sun begins to descend, note the time again
- The midpoint between these two times is local noon
- The average of the two altitude readings provides the meridian altitude

**Accuracy Expectations**:

- With practiced sextant technique, noon fixes routinely achieve accuracy within 1 nautical mile for latitude
- Longitude accuracy typically within 5 nautical miles
- This accuracy is more than sufficient for safe landfall after days at sea

**Advantages**:

- Simple calculation with minimal tables required
- Provides exact latitude
- Does not require precise time measurement
- Can be performed daily in clear weather
- Less susceptible to calculation errors than full sight reduction

### 1.2 Star Navigation

#### Polaris (Northern Hemisphere)

Polaris, the North Star, provides the simplest method for determining latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.

**Basic Principle**:

- Polaris remains within 1 degree of the celestial north pole
- The angle between Polaris and the horizon equals your approximate latitude
- If Polaris is 10 degrees above the horizon, you are approximately 10 degrees north of the equator

**Correction Process**:

1. Measure the altitude of Polaris with sextant (Hs)
2. Apply index error correction
3. Apply dip correction for height of eye
4. Apply refraction correction
5. Calculate Local Hour Angle (LHA) of Aries from nautical almanac
6. Apply Polaris corrections from almanac tables
7. Result: Accurate latitude to within a fraction of a mile

**Limitations**:

- Polaris provides latitude only, not longitude
- Cannot be used for complete position fix
- Invisible south of the equator
- Must be combined with other observations for full navigation solution

#### Southern Cross (Southern Hemisphere)

The Southern Cross constellation provides directional guidance in the Southern Hemisphere but cannot directly determine latitude.

**Finding South**:

1. Identify the four brightest stars forming the cross shape
2. Draw an imaginary line through Gacrux (top) and Acrux (bottom, brightest star)
3. Extend this line from Acrux for 4.5 times the length of the cross
4. This point marks the South Celestial Pole
5. Drop a vertical line from this point to the horizon
6. Where the line meets the horizon indicates true south

**Key Facts**:

- Southern Cross is circumpolar south of 34° latitude (never sets)
- Not visible north of +20° latitude
- Too far from celestial pole for latitude calculations
- Primarily useful for direction finding
- Visible year-round in southern latitudes

#### Selected Navigation Stars

57 selected stars have daily positions listed in nautical almanacs, chosen for:

- Brightness and easy identification
- Distribution across the celestial sphere
- Proximity to the ecliptic (path of sun and planets)
- Usefulness for sight reduction calculations

**Most Important Navigation Stars**:

- First Magnitude: Sirius, Canopus, Arcturus, Vega, Capella, Rigel, Procyon, Betelgeuse, Altair, Aldebaran, Spica, Antares, Pollux, Fomalhaut, Deneb, Regulus
- Used for twilight observations when both stars and horizon are visible
- Require sight reduction tables or calculations for position lines

#### Planet Identification

Planets appear as very bright "stars" that don't twinkle:

- Venus: Brightest object after sun and moon, visible at dawn or dusk
- Jupiter: Second brightest planet, steady white light
- Mars: Reddish color distinguishes it
- Saturn: Yellowish, dimmer than Jupiter
- Planets move slowly against star background over days/weeks

### 1.3 Moon Navigation

#### Moon Sights for Position Lines

The moon can provide position lines similar to sun or star sights but requires special considerations:

**Unique Challenges**:

- Moon's orbit around Earth (27.3 days) causes rapid position changes (13.18° per day)
- Significant parallax effect requires special corrections
- Changing semidiameter as distance from Earth varies
- Available for observations both day and night
- Not always visible or well-positioned for sights

**Correction Requirements**:

1. Index error
2. Dip (height of eye)
3. Refraction
4. Semidiameter (upper or lower limb observed)
5. Parallax correction (significant, unlike sun/stars)
6. Augmentation of semidiameter

**Advantages**:

- Available when sun and stars are not
- Moves rapidly against star background
- Can provide multiple observations per day
- Useful for running fixes

#### Lunar Distance Method (Historical)

The lunar distance method was the primary means of determining longitude before reliable chronometers became available (1763-1850s).

**Fundamental Principle**:

- The moon acts as the hour hand of a celestial clock
- Stars along the moon's path serve as hour markers
- Measuring the moon's angular distance from specific stars or sun reveals Greenwich Time
- Comparing Greenwich Time with local time (from sun sight) yields longitude
- Each hour of time difference equals 15 degrees of longitude

**Process**:

1. **Measurement**: Use sextant to precisely measure angle between moon and sun or selected star
2. **Clearing**: Apply corrections for parallax and refraction using trigonometric calculations
3. **Time Determination**: Compare corrected lunar distance with almanac tables to find Greenwich Time
4. **Longitude Calculation**: Determine local time from sun altitude, calculate longitude from time difference

**Modern Relevance**:

- Provides backup method for determining time if chronometer fails
- Requires only sextant and nautical almanac (no chronometer needed)
- Calculations are complex but achievable with practice
- Increasingly taught as backup to GPS time dependence
- Critical survival skill if all electronic timekeeping fails

### 1.5 Sight Reduction Techniques and Calculations

#### Modern Intercept Method (Marcq St. Hilaire)

The standard method used in modern celestial navigation.

**Concept**:

- Select an Assumed Position (AP) near your dead reckoning position
- Calculate where a celestial body should appear from that position (Computed altitude Hc and azimuth Zn)
- Compare with actual observed altitude (Ho)
- The difference (intercept) is the distance to move the position line toward or away from the body's geographical position

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Measure and Record**:
   - Note exact time of sight (UTC)
   - Record sextant altitude (Hs)
   - Identify celestial body observed

2. **Apply Corrections**:
   - Index error -> Observed altitude
   - Dip (height of eye) -> Apparent altitude (Ha)
   - Refraction, semidiameter, parallax -> Observed altitude (Ho)

3. **Choose Assumed Position**:
   - Latitude: Nearest whole degree to DR position
   - Longitude: Value that makes Local Hour Angle (LHA) a whole degree

4. **Extract Almanac Data** (for time of sight):
   - Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA)
   - Declination (Dec)

5. **Calculate Local Hour Angle**:
   - LHA = GHA + Longitude (if west, subtract)
   - Adjust to ensure LHA is 0-360°

6. **Enter Sight Reduction Tables** (or calculate):
   - Using AP Latitude, LHA, and Declination
   - Extract Computed altitude (Hc) and Azimuth (Zn)

7. **Calculate Intercept**:
   - Intercept = Ho - Hc
   - If positive: "Toward" (position line closer to body's GP)
   - If negative: "Away" (position line farther from body's GP)

8. **Plot Position Line**:
   - From AP, draw line along azimuth Zn
   - Mark intercept distance along this line
   - Draw position line perpendicular to azimuth
   - Your position is somewhere on this line

9. **Obtain Fix**:
   - Minimum two position lines needed for fix
   - Three or more bodies provide better accuracy
   - Lines should cross at angles close to 90° for best accuracy

#### Alternative Methods

**Time Sight (Ex-Meridian)**:

- For observations within 30 minutes of local noon
- Less accurate than full sight reduction
- Simpler calculation
- Useful when tables not available

**Line of Position (Sumner) Method**:

- Historical method discovered 1837
- Calculate position at multiple trial latitudes
- Positions fall along a line
- More time-consuming than intercept method

### 1.6 Common Errors and Corrections

#### Measurement Errors

**Index Error**:

- Caused by misalignment of sextant mirrors
- Check regularly by measuring horizon at zero reading
- "On the arc" error: subtract from reading
- "Off the arc" error: add to reading
- Should be minimal with proper sextant adjustment

**Dip Error (Height of Eye)**:

- Always negative for observations above sea level
- Formula: Dip (minutes) = 0.97 x sqrt(height in feet)
- Abnormal atmospheric refraction can cause 10' variation from tables
- Greater error in unusual weather conditions
- Apply correction from tables based on height of eye

**Refraction Error**:

- Light bends through atmosphere
- Most significant error for altitudes below 15°
- Increases dramatically near horizon
- Standard tables assume normal atmospheric conditions
- Abnormal conditions (temperature inversions, etc.) can cause significant errors
- Avoid very low altitude sights when possible

**Parallax Error**:

- Most significant for moon (large correction required)
- Sun parallax approximately 0.1' (minimal)
- Stars/planets have negligible parallax (infinite distance)
- Moon parallax can exceed 60' - must be corrected
- Varies with altitude and moon's distance from Earth

**Semidiameter Error**:

- Applies only to sun and moon (measure limb, not center)
- Sun SD approximately 16' (varies slightly with season)
- Moon SD varies from 15' to 17' (orbital distance variation)
- Upper limb: subtract SD
- Lower limb: add SD
- Stars and planets: center observed, no SD correction

#### Time Errors

**Chronometer Error**:

- 4 seconds of time = 1 nautical mile of longitude error
- At equator: Earth rotates 500 meters per second
- Critical for longitude determination
- Check chronometer against radio time signals when available
- Record chronometer error and rate of change
- Wind mechanical chronometers at same time daily

**Observation Timing Error**:

- Record exact UTC time when body touches horizon
- Practice timing technique
- Use stopwatch for precision
- Anticipate the moment of contact
- Sea motion makes timing challenging

#### Instrument Errors

**Sextant Calibration**:

- Permanent arc errors from manufacturing
- Noted on certificate inside sextant case
- Generally very small on quality instruments
- Apply as constant correction if significant

**Personal Error**:

- Difficulty keeping body on horizon (sea motion)
- Tendency to rock sextant incorrectly
- Improper eye position at telescope
- Reduced with practice

**Mitigating Errors**:

1. Practice extensively in calm conditions first
2. Take multiple sights and average results
3. Use proper sextant rocking technique
4. Check index error before each session
5. Apply all corrections systematically
6. Cross-check calculations
7. Compare with dead reckoning position
8. Use work forms to prevent omitted corrections

## 2. Non-Electronic Navigation

### 2.1 Dead Reckoning Techniques

Dead reckoning (DR) is the fundamental skill of calculating current position based on previously known position, course, speed, and time elapsed.

**Basic Formula**: Distance = Speed x Time

**Essential Components**:

1. Last known position (fix or previous DR)
2. Course steered (compass heading corrected for variation/deviation)
3. Speed through water (log reading or estimate)
4. Time elapsed
5. Estimated leeway (sideways drift from wind)
6. Current/tide set and drift

**DR Process**:

1. **Start with Known Position**:
   - Last celestial fix, visual fix, or GPS position
   - Mark clearly on chart with circle and time

2. **Plot Course Made Good**:
   - Convert compass course to true course
   - Account for steering errors and yawing
   - Draw course line from last position

3. **Calculate Distance Run**:
   - Use log reading or estimated speed
   - Distance = Speed (knots) x Time (hours)
   - Mark DR position at regular intervals (hourly for ocean passages)

4. **Account for Leeway**:
   - Sailing vessels drift sideways from wind pressure
   - Estimate leeway angle (typically 3-10°)
   - Apply rule: Wind from starboard - subtract leeway angle
   - Wind from port - add leeway angle
   - Results in "course made good through water"

5. **Apply Current Effects**:
   - Determine set (direction) and drift (speed) of current
   - Calculate current's distance/direction over time period
   - Plot as vector from DR position
   - Result is Estimated Position (EP)

**DR Position Marking Convention**:

- DR position: Semi-circle with dot
- EP (with current): Triangle with dot
- Fix: Circle with dot
- Label all positions with time

**Accuracy Considerations**:

- DR accuracy degrades over time
- Errors in course, speed, leeway, and current compound
- Update with celestial fix or visual fix when possible
- DR positions typically accurate to 5-10% of distance run in good conditions
- Can be significantly less accurate in challenging conditions

**When DR is Essential**:

- Between celestial fixes
- Cloudy weather preventing celestial observations
- Approaching land (combined with depth sounding)
- Verifying celestial fixes for gross errors
- Emergency navigation if all other methods fail

### 2.2 Compass Navigation and Deviation/Variation

#### Variation (Declination)

**Definition**: The angular difference between True North and Magnetic North at any location

**Characteristics**:

- Varies with geographic location
- Changes slowly over time (secular variation)
- Shown on charts at compass rose center
- Noted with year and annual change rate

**Application**:

- Converting True to Magnetic: True + West Variation = Magnetic
- Converting Magnetic to True: Magnetic + East Variation = True
- Memory aid: "West is best" (add west when going T to M)
- Memory aid: "East is least" (subtract east when going T to M)

**Chart Information**:

- Variation marked on chart compass rose
- Example: "Var 14° 30'W (2020) Annual change 0° 05'W"
- Update for years since chart publication

#### Deviation

**Definition**: Angular difference between Magnetic North and Compass North caused by vessel's magnetic field

**Causes**:

- Engine and metal hull/components
- Batteries and electrical systems
- Speakers and electronics
- Tools and equipment stowed near compass
- Changes with vessel's heading

**Deviation Card**:

- Created by professional compass adjuster or careful self-calibration
- Lists deviation for each compass heading
- Updated whenever major changes to vessel
- Kept near compass for ready reference

**Creating Deviation Card** (Basic Method):

1. Find location with known magnetic bearing to distant object
2. Motor or sail on various headings
3. Observe compass bearing to known object on each heading
4. Calculate deviation for each heading
5. Record on deviation card

**Application**:

- Converting Magnetic to Compass: Magnetic + East dev = Compass
- Converting Compass to Magnetic: Compass + West dev = Magnetic
- Must apply for vessel's current heading

#### CADET Memory System

Converting between Compass, Magnetic, and True courses:

**C**ompass -> **A**pply **D**eviation -> **M**agnetic -> **A**pply **V**ariation -> **T**rue

**Going from Compass to True (C->T)**:

- Add EAST deviation and variation
- Subtract WEST deviation and variation
- "CADET" -> Add East

**Going from True to Compass (T->C)**:

- Reverse the process
- Subtract EAST deviation and variation
- Add WEST deviation and variation

**Example Calculation**:

- Compass course: 090°
- Deviation: 3°E
- Variation: 15°W

Compass: 090°

- Dev 3°E: = 093° Magnetic

- Var 15°W: = 078° True

**Alternative Memory Aids**:

- "Can Dead Men Vote Twice" (Compass-Deviation-Magnetic-Variation-True)
- "True Virgins Make Dull Companions" (reverse direction)
- "Error East, Compass Least; Error West, Compass Best"

#### Compass Compensation and Adjustment

**Professional Adjustment**:

- Compensator adjusts internal magnets
- Minimizes deviation on all headings
- Residual deviation recorded on card
- Recommended every 2-3 years or after major vessel changes

**Monitoring Compass Health**:

- Compare compass readings with handheld compass away from interference
- Check against celestial bearings when possible
- Verify against known ranges/transits
- Watch for sudden changes indicating new magnetic interference

**Emergency Compass Use**:

- If compass suspect, use sun/star bearings
- Create temporary deviation card using celestial bodies
- Remove sources of interference if identified
- Use handheld compass away from interference

### 2.3 Chart Plotting Without GPS

#### Chart Basics

**Chart Selection**:

- Large scale (1:50,000 or larger) for coastal navigation
- Small scale (1:500,000+) for ocean passages
- Pilot charts for seasonal weather and current patterns
- Latest edition with corrections applied

**Chart Information**:

- Depths in meters or fathoms (check chart notes)
- Compass roses showing True and Magnetic North
- Latitude/longitude scales on edges
- Symbols for aids to navigation
- Shoreline features and landmarks
- Danger areas and restricted zones

#### Essential Plotting Techniques

**Measuring Distance**:

- Use dividers on latitude scale (1 minute = 1 nautical mile)
- Never use longitude scale for distance
- Walk dividers along course line for long distances
- Distance formula: 60 x minutes of latitude = nautical miles

**Measuring Direction**:

- Use parallel rulers to transfer bearing to nearest compass rose
- Or use plotting triangle/protractor on meridian line
- Always use inner (magnetic) or outer (true) rose consistently
- Check which North reference you're using

**Plotting a Fix**:

1. Take bearings to 2-3 known landmarks
2. Convert compass bearings to true (or use magnetic)
3. Plot reciprocal bearing FROM each landmark
4. Where lines cross is your position
5. Three lines form "cocked hat" - position inside triangle

**Plotting a Course Line**:

1. Draw line from departure point to destination
2. Measure true direction using compass rose
3. Note total distance
4. Convert true to compass course for steering
5. Mark course and distance on line

**Allowing for Current/Tide**:

1. Draw intended track from A to B
2. From A, draw vector showing current set and drift
3. From end of current vector, swing arc equal to boat speed
4. Where arc intersects intended track is where you'll be after one hour
5. Measure course from A to this point - this is course to steer

### 2.4 Piloting Using Visual Bearings

Visual piloting uses observed bearings to known landmarks for precise position fixing in coastal waters.

#### Taking Visual Bearings

**Equipment**:

- Hand bearing compass
- Binoculars with compass (if available)
- Pelorus (if mounted)
- Naked eye for relative bearings

**Technique**:

1. Identify landmark positively on chart
2. Aim compass at base of landmark (waterline if possible)
3. Wait for compass to settle
4. Read bearing when stable
5. Record immediately with time
6. Take 2-3 bearings quickly (vessel is moving)

**Selecting Landmarks**:

- Prominent, easily identified features
- Fixed structures (lighthouses, towers, church spires)
- Natural features (headlands, mountain peaks)
- Precisely charted positions
- Well distributed (ideal: 60-90° apart)

#### Plotting Visual Fixes

**Standard Three-Bearing Fix**:

1. Take three bearings within 1-2 minutes
2. Convert all to true bearings
3. Plot reciprocal (opposite) bearing FROM each landmark
4. Three lines should intersect closely
5. Small triangle ("cocked hat") indicates minor errors
6. Position is inside triangle, usually nearest danger

**Two-Bearing Fix**:

- Faster than three bearings
- Less reliable if one bearing has error
- Use when only two landmarks available
- Choose landmarks with good angular separation

**Running Fix**:

- Uses single landmark and vessel motion
- Take first bearing when landmark forward of beam
- Note time and log reading
- Continue on course, recording DR
- Take second bearing when landmark abaft beam
- Transfer first bearing line by distance/direction run
- Intersection with second bearing is running fix
- Less accurate than simultaneous bearings
- Useful when only one landmark visible

**Special Techniques**:

*Doubling the Angle on the Bow*:

- Note bearing when landmark at 30° off bow
- Continue on course
- When bearing reaches 60° off bow, distance off equals distance run
- Quick estimate of distance to landmark

*Four-Point Fix*:

- First bearing at 45° off bow
- Second bearing at 90° off bow
- Distance off at second bearing equals distance run between bearings

*Bearing and Distance*:

- Bearing alone gives line of position
- Add radar distance or visual distance estimate
- Single observation gives fix

#### Transit (Range) Observations

**Definition**: Two objects in line form a transit, providing extremely accurate position line

**Advantages**:

- No compass needed
- More accurate than compass bearing
- Instantaneous (no timing issues)
- Not affected by compass error

**Uses**:

- Entering harbors (leading ranges)
- Checking compass deviation
- Marking channels in restricted waters
- Determining exact moment for course change

**Natural Transits**:

- Any two charted objects
- Edge of island aligned with headland
- Church steeple behind dock
- Water tower between two hills

### 2.5 Lead Line and Depth Sounding

The lead line is one of the oldest navigation tools, providing depth information and bottom samples without electronics.

#### Lead Line Construction

**Components**:

- Hemp or synthetic line: 25-30 fathoms (150-180 feet) for coastal work
- Lead weight: 7-14 pounds (3-6 kg)
- Arming: Tallow or grease in hollow at bottom of lead
- Marks: Traditional system or modern alternatives

**Traditional Marking System**:

- 2 fathoms: Two leather strips
- 3 fathoms: Three leather strips
- 5 fathoms: White cloth
- 7 fathoms: Red cloth
- 10 fathoms: Leather with hole
- 13 fathoms: Blue cloth
- 15 fathoms: White cloth
- 17 fathoms: Red cloth
- 20 fathoms: Two knots

**Why This System**:

- Can be "read" by feel at night
- Distinctive shapes and textures
- Marked fathoms are "marks"
- Unmarked depths are "deeps"
- Leadsman calls "by the mark 5" or "by the deep 6"

#### Taking Soundings

**Procedure**:

1. Position forward on vessel, to windward if possible
2. Swing lead forward with pendulum motion
3. Release when lead swings forward
4. Line should be vertical when lead hits bottom
5. Read depth at waterline when line goes slack
6. Retrieve and prepare for next cast

**Speed Limitations**:

- Accurate soundings only possible under 3-4 knots
- Faster speeds cause line to drag aft
- Heave to for most accurate soundings
- Slow down when approaching shoal water

**Interpreting Results**:

- Sudden shoaling indicates danger - slow immediately
- Gradual depth change confirms expected position
- Bottom type from arming confirms chart information
- Sequence of soundings can identify location on chart

#### Navigation with Soundings

**Depth Contour Navigation**:

- Follow specific depth contour (e.g., 10-fathom line)
- Useful in fog or poor visibility
- Verify position by matching depths with chart
- Series of soundings confirm vessel track

**Crossing a Bar**:

- Use lead line to find deepest channel
- Multiple soundings locate safe passage
- Bottom type indicates channel vs. bar
- Time to cross with sufficient tide height

**Position Verification**:

- Take soundings at regular intervals
- Compare with charted depths
- Sequence of depths confirms DR position
- Sudden disagreement indicates error in navigation

**Bottom Sampling**:

- Arm the lead with tallow or soft wax
- Bottom material adheres to arming
- Compare with chart notation (sand, mud, rock, shells, coral)
- Confirms position and provides anchorage information

**Traditional Bottom Notations on Charts**:

- S: Sand
- M: Mud
- Cy: Clay
- R: Rock
- Co: Coral
- Sh: Shells
- G: Gravel
- St: Stones
- Wd: Weed

### 2.6 Current and Leeway Calculations

#### Leeway (Wind-Induced Drift)

**Definition**: Sideways movement of vessel through water caused by wind pressure on hull and rigging

**Factors Affecting Leeway**:

- Wind strength: Stronger wind = more leeway
- Point of sail: Close-hauled = most leeway; running = least leeway
- Hull shape: Shallow draft = more leeway
- Keel design: Fin keel = less leeway than full keel
- Heel angle: Greater heel = more leeway
- Sail balance: Poor trim = more leeway

**Estimating Leeway**:

- Light wind (5-15 kts): 3-5° typical
- Moderate wind (15-25 kts): 5-10° typical
- Strong wind (25+ kts): 10-15° or more
- Check wake angle relative to centerline
- More art than science - develops with experience

**Applying Leeway to DR**:

- Wind from starboard: Subtract leeway from compass course
- Wind from port: Add leeway to compass course
- Example: Course 139°T, wind from southwest, 10° leeway = 129°T course made good
- Result is course made good through water (not over ground)

#### Current Effects (Set and Drift)

**Terminology**:

- Set: Direction current is flowing (TO, not FROM)
- Drift: Speed of current in knots
- Both must be considered for accurate DR

**Sources of Current**:

- Tidal streams: Predictable from tide tables and charts
- Ocean currents: Shown on pilot charts
- Wind-driven currents: Develop after sustained winds
- River outflows: Near estuaries
- Local effects: Headlands, channels, underwater topography

**Determining Current**:

*From Publications*:

- Tidal current tables (coastal waters)
- Tidal stream atlases (European waters)
- Pilot charts (ocean currents, monthly averages)
- Sailing directions (local current information)

*From Observation*:

- Anchored boat's heading and motion
- Buoy lean and wake patterns
- Water moving past stationary object
- Difference between DR position and fix

**Calculating Current Effects**:

*Known Current Method*:

1. Plot intended course from A to B
2. From A, draw current vector (set and drift for time period)
3. From end of current vector, measure distance boat will travel
4. Where this intersects track line is where you'll arrive
5. Course from A to this point is course to steer

*Unknown Current Method*:

1. Maintain steady compass course and speed
2. After reasonable time (2-4 hours), take fix
3. Compare fix to DR position
4. Vector from DR to fix shows current set and drift
5. Adjust course to compensate for discovered current

**Current Sailing Strategy**:

- Seek favorable currents
- Avoid adverse currents when possible
- Cross strong currents at angle, not perpendicular
- Use back eddies near shore in tidal streams
- Time passages through channels for favorable tide

### 2.7 Weather Routing Without Forecast Models

When modern weather forecasting is unavailable, traditional weather observation and interpretation becomes critical.

#### Barometer Reading and Trends

**Equipment**:

- Aneroid barometer (mechanical, no power needed)
- Record readings every 3-4 hours
- Graph trends over several days
- Normal atmospheric pressure: 1013 mb (29.92" Hg)

**Interpreting Barometric Trends**:

*Falling Barometer*:

- Slow fall (1-3 mb/3 hrs): Weather deteriorating gradually
- Rapid fall (3-6 mb/3 hrs): Strong system approaching, prepare for heavy weather
- Very rapid fall (6+ mb/3 hrs): Severe weather imminent, take storm precautions

*Rising Barometer*:

- Slow rise: Weather improving gradually
- Rapid rise: Quick improvement but often followed by unstable conditions
- Steady rise: Fair weather establishing

*Steady Barometer*:

- High pressure (1020+ mb): Fair weather likely to continue
- Low pressure (1000- mb): Poor weather likely to continue
- Must consider other indicators

**Important**: Trends more important than absolute values. A rising barometer at 1005 mb may indicate improving conditions more than a falling barometer at 1015 mb.

#### Cloud Observation and Interpretation

**High Clouds (above 20,000 ft)**:

*Cirrus (Ci)*:

- Thin, wispy, mare's tails
- First sign of approaching warm front
- Weather change in 24-48 hours
- Direction of movement shows wind aloft

*Cirrocumulus (Cc)*:

- Small ripples, "mackerel sky"
- Often precedes weather change
- "Mackerel sky, mackerel sky, never long wet, never long dry"

*Cirrostratus (Cs)*:

- Thin sheet, often with halo around sun/moon
- Warm front approaching
- Rain within 24 hours if thickening

**Middle Clouds (6,500-20,000 ft)**:

*Altostratus (As)*:

- Gray sheet, sun visible as if through frosted glass
- Warm front approaching
- Rain likely within 12 hours

*Altocumulus (Ac)*:

- Gray/white patches or rolls
- Can indicate afternoon thunderstorms
- "Castellanus" form (tower-like) suggests instability

**Low Clouds (below 6,500 ft)**:

*Stratus (St)*:

- Uniform gray layer
- Drizzle or light rain
- Poor visibility
- Usually not threatening to vessels

*Stratocumulus (Sc)*:

- Gray lumpy masses
- Usually fair weather
- May produce light rain/drizzle

*Nimbostratus (Ns)*:

- Dark, thick, shapeless
- Continuous rain
- Associated with warm fronts
- Low visibility

**Vertical Development Clouds**:

*Cumulus (Cu)*:

- Fair weather: Small, cotton-ball, flat bases
- Building: Growing taller indicates instability
- "Towering cumulus" can develop into thunderstorms

*Cumulonimbus (Cb)*:

- Massive towers, anvil top
- Thunderstorms with heavy rain, lightning, strong winds
- Dangerous to vessels
- Avoid if possible, reduce sail if unavoidable

#### Wind Patterns and Shifts

**Wind Shift Interpretation**:

*Veering Wind* (clockwise shift):

- Northern Hemisphere: Usually indicates warm front passage or clearing
- Example: SW wind shifts to W then NW
- Often accompanied by rising barometer
- Weather typically improving

*Backing Wind* (counterclockwise shift):

- Northern Hemisphere: Usually indicates cold front approaching
- Example: S wind shifts to SE then E
- Often accompanied by falling barometer
- Weather typically deteriorating

*Southern Hemisphere*: Opposite patterns apply

**Buys Ballot's Law** (Northern Hemisphere):

- Stand with back to wind
- Low pressure is to your left
- High pressure is to your right
- Helps locate weather systems without instruments

#### Swell Patterns

**Reading Ocean Swells**:

- Swell direction indicates distant weather system
- Multiple swell trains from different directions
- Long-period swell (15+ seconds): Distant storm
- Short-period swell (8-10 seconds): Nearby system

**Swell vs. Wind Waves**:

- Swells: Long, regular, from distant storms
- Wind waves: Short, irregular, from local winds
- Swells arrive before storm
- Increasing swell height suggests approaching system

**Strategic Use**:

- Sail with swell when possible (faster, more comfortable)
- Against swell: slower, more rolling motion
- Crossed swells indicate complex weather pattern

#### Traditional Weather Sayings (with basis in fact)

**Sky Observations**:

- "Red sky at night, sailor's delight": High pressure system with clear air to west
- "Red sky in morning, sailors take warning": Clear air to east, system approaching from west
- "Mackerel sky and mare's tails make tall ships carry low sails": Cirrus and cirrocumulus indicate front approaching

**Pressure Observations**:

- "Long foretold, long last; short notice, soon past": Slow pressure changes last longer
- "First rise after low indicates stronger blow": Rapid pressure rise often brings strong winds

**Wind Observations**:

- "Wind before rain, soon set sail again": Quick passing shower
- "Rain before wind, topsails you must mind": Front approaching with sustained winds

#### Practical Weather Routing Without Forecasts

**Daily Routine**:

1. Record barometer reading every watch change
2. Graph pressure trend
3. Observe and record cloud types and coverage
4. Note wind direction and strength
5. Observe swell direction and period
6. Record sea temperature (can indicate current)
7. Note any unusual observations

**Decision Making**:

- Integrate all observations
- Pressure trend is primary indicator
- Cloud sequence confirms system approach
- Wind shifts time the system's passage
- Prepare early when indicators suggest deterioration
- Conservative approach: reef early, reduce sail before conditions require it

**Route Adjustments**:

- Alter course to avoid developing systems when possible
- Seek favorable wind patterns
- Use currents to best advantage
- Allow extra sea room before weather deterioration
- Plan refuge harbors if coastal cruising

## 3. Heavy Weather Seamanship

### 3.1 Storm Tactics Overview

No single storm tactic works for all boats in all conditions. Success depends on vessel design, equipment available, sea conditions, sea room, crew condition, and storm characteristics. Practice multiple tactics and develop experience with your specific vessel.

**Fundamental Principle**: All storm tactics aim to reduce strain and motion by pointing one end of the vessel (bow or stern) toward the waves, minimizing beam-on exposure.

**Key Variables**:

- Hull shape and keel design (fin keel vs. full keel)
- Vessel size and displacement
- Sea room available
- Proximity to lee shore
- Wave height and period
- Wind strength
- Crew experience and fatigue
- Duration of storm expected

### 3.2 Heaving-To

**Description**: The boat balances jib aback against reefed main, slowly sailing forward at 1-2 knots while making significant leeway at 60° to wind.

**How to Heave-To**:

1. Tack without releasing jib sheet (jib backwinds on wrong side)
2. Trim main in moderately hard
3. Lash helm to weather (tiller to windward, wheel to leeward)
4. Boat establishes equilibrium drift pattern

**The Self-Regulating Cycle**:

- Backwinded jib pushes bow down away from wind
- Boat begins moving forward
- Rudder (lashed to weather) turns bow back into wind
- Main fills, boat gains speed
- Helm action pushes bow into wind again
- Main luffs, jib takes over
- Cycle repeats

**Advantages**:

- Dramatically reduced motion compared to sailing or lying ahull
- Crew can rest below
- Some forward progress maintained
- Boat remains under control
- Can prepare meals, rest, make repairs
- Excellent tactic for crew rest in gales

**Disadvantages**:

- Modern fin-keel boats often heave-to poorly
- Requires sea room to leeward (making 1-2 knots leeway)
- Not suitable near lee shore
- Less effective in very steep, breaking seas
- Some boats won't heave-to reliably

**Variations**:

- Storm jib or deeply reefed jib instead of full jib
- Storm trysail instead of reefed main
- Some boats heave-to better under jib alone

**When to Use**:

- Crew exhaustion requires rest
- Waiting for daylight before landfall
- Severe conditions exceed crew capability to sail safely
- Need time for repairs or emergency procedures
- Ample sea room to leeward

### 3.3 Sea Anchor Deployment

**Description**: Parachute-type drogue deployed from bow holds vessel head-to-wind and waves, essentially stopping forward progress.

**Typical Setup**:

- Parachute diameter: 9-18 feet depending on vessel size
- Heavy-duty nylon construction
- Swivel to prevent line twist
- Trip line for retrieval
- 200-400 feet of rode
- Deployed from bow, secured to primary anchor cleat or samson post

**How Sea Anchor Works**:

- Creates massive drag in water
- Holds bow 40-45° to wind
- Vessel drifts slowly downwind (0.5-1 knot)
- Bow rises to meet waves
- Reduces impact of breaking seas

**Deployment Process**:

1. Attach rode to sea anchor with swivel
2. Attach trip line to apex of parachute
3. Stream sea anchor from bow
4. Pay out rode to full length (200-400 feet)
5. Secure rode to strongest point on bow
6. Rig bridle if necessary to keep bow into waves
7. Deploy riding sail from stern if needed to keep bow oriented

**Advantages**:

- Vessel held in safest orientation (bow to seas)
- Crew can remain below in safety
- Minimal drift (maintains position)
- Most passive tactic (minimal crew intervention)
- Suitable for very severe conditions
- Can ride out storm for extended period

**Disadvantages**:

- Extreme loads on bow fittings and rode
- Risk of rode chafe
- Difficult retrieval in heavy weather
- Requires specialized, expensive equipment
- May cause vessel to "sail" back and forth
- Some modern hull designs don't respond well
- Fin-keel boats may not stay oriented properly

**Critical Requirements**:

- Exceptionally strong bow attachment points
- Heavy-duty rode (3/4" to 1" nylon)
- Comprehensive chafe protection
- Properly sized sea anchor for vessel displacement
- Clear procedure for deployment before conditions deteriorate
- Trip line system for retrieval

**When to Use**:

- Extreme conditions beyond other tactics
- Plenty of sea room in all directions
- Crew unable to maintain other tactics
- Long duration storm expected
- Vessel's design suits this tactic

### 3.4 Running Off and Drogue Deployment

**Description**: Sail or run downwind before the storm, using drogue from stern to limit speed and prevent surfing.

**Drogue Types**:

*Series Drogue*:

- Multiple small cones on long line
- Distributes load evenly
- Less shock loading than single drogue
- Developed by Donald Jordan
- Regarded as most effective by many experts

*Parachute Drogue*:

- Single large parachute
- Deployed from stern
- More shock loading than series drogue
- Can be improvised from sea anchor

*Improvised Drogues*:

- Trailing warps (heavy lines in bights)
- Tires on lines
- Chain and anchor
- Combination of available gear

**How Running with Drogue Works**:

- Drogue limits speed to 3-6 knots
- Prevents surfing down wave faces
- Maintains steerage
- Keeps stern to waves
- Allows steering to avoid worst breaking crests

**Advantages**:

- Vessel remains under control
- Can steer away from dangerous breaking waves
- Natural position for most hull designs
- Uses boat speed for stability
- Can make progress toward destination
- Less strain than lying ahull

**Disadvantages**:

- Requires crew on deck steering
- Crew exhaustion a major factor
- Risk of broach if drogue fails
- Requires sea room ahead
- Cannot use near lee shore
- Risk of pooping (stern wave breaking aboard)
- Extreme rudder loads

**Deployment Process**:

1. Reduce sail or run under bare poles
2. Stream drogue from stern quarter
3. Pay out sufficient scope (300+ feet for series drogue)
4. Secure to primary winches or cleats
5. Rig steering lines if autopilot/windvane overwhelmed
6. Monitor and adjust continuously

**Steering Technique**:

- Watch waves approaching from astern
- Adjust course to take dangerous crests at angle
- Prevent broaching by maintaining stern-to-seas orientation
- Use just enough power to maintain steerage
- Rest crew frequently - extremely demanding

**When to Use**:

- Adequate sea room to leeward
- Crew capable of sustained steering
- Vessel design suits running off
- Want to make progress toward destination
- Conditions not yet extreme enough for lying to sea anchor

### 3.5 Lying Ahull

**Description**: Drop all sails, lash helm to leeward, allow vessel to drift beam-to-wind and waves.

**Setup**:

- All sails down and secured
- Helm lashed to leeward
- All crew below
- Hatches secured
- Vessel drifts sideways at approximately 1-2 knots

**How It Works** (or doesn't):

- Vessel presents beam to waves
- Natural drift creates slick to windward
- Boat rides over waves sideways
- Completely passive - no crew action required

**SEVERE WARNING**:
Lying ahull is widely considered the most dangerous storm tactic for monohull sailboats. This tactic is most likely to result in:

- Knockdowns (mast to water)
- 360° rolls
- Dismasting
- Catastrophic damage
- Crew injury

**When Lying Ahull is Acceptable**:

- Multihulls (different stability characteristics)
- Short-term only while preparing other tactics
- Very limited sea room prevents other options
- Crew incapacitated and no other choice
- Vessel specifically designed for this tactic

**When to NEVER Lie Ahull**:

- Monohull sailboat in severe breaking seas
- When any other option is available
- Extended period expected
- Ultimate storm conditions

**Last Resort Consideration**:

- Only when absolutely no other option remains
- Accept high risk of catastrophic consequences
- Crew must be secured below with hatch boards in place
- Expect possible knockdown
- Be prepared for worst-case scenarios

### 3.6 Storm Sail Configurations

**Purpose**: Maintain control and reduce strain in heavy weather while keeping some sail power for maneuverability.

#### Storm Trysail

**Description**: Small, strong triangular sail set in place of mainsail

**Design Features**:

- Bright orange color for visibility
- Heavy sailcloth (8-10 oz or heavier)
- Reinforced corners with multiple cringles
- Slides on separate track or uses gate above furled main
- Tack typically higher than boom gooseneck
- Clew adjustable with dedicated sheets

**Advantages**:

- Can be set without removing mainsail
- High tack keeps sail above breaking seas
- Does not use boom (boom can be secured if damaged)
- Provides drive and balance in storm conditions
- Enables heaving-to or controlled sailing

**Rigging Storm Trysail**:

1. Lower and secure mainsail (or furl in-mast/boom furling)
2. Attach trysail slides to dedicated track or feed into main track above main
3. Secure tack to strong point on mast (not boom)
4. Attach dedicated sheets to clew, lead outside all rigging
5. Hoist and trim as needed

**Important**: Set trysail while conditions still permit safe work on deck. Waiting too long makes deployment dangerous or impossible.

#### Storm Jib

**Description**: Small, strong headsail, typically 5% or less of foretriangle area

**Design Features**:

- High-visibility color (orange or yellow)
- Heavy sailcloth
- Heavily reinforced corners
- Typically hanked to inner forestay
- Minimal overlap with mast

**Setup**:

- Pre-hanked to inner forestay if available
- Dedicated sheets pre-rigged
- Can be deployed quickly when needed
- Removed quickly if conditions worsen further

**Alternative - Deep-Reefed Working Jib**:

- Furling headsail rolled to small area
- Less ideal than dedicated storm jib
- UV cover creates thick roll affecting shape
- May not be strong enough for extreme conditions
- Acceptable for moderate gales

#### Reefing Strategy

**Progressive Sail Reduction**:

1. First reef when considering it (early reefing principle)
2. Second reef before first reef seems inadequate
3. Third reef or storm sails before second reef overwhelmed
4. Bare poles if storm sails too much

**Reefing as Balancing Tactic**:

- Reef main more than jib to reduce weather helm
- Reef jib more than main to reduce lee helm
- Balanced helm requires less rudder force
- Easier steering and less strain on gear

**Timing**:

- Reef in calm conditions before they're needed
- Much easier and safer than reefing in storm
- "Reef early, reef often" is key principle
- Never push sail beyond crew capability to manage

**Heavy Weather Sail Combinations**:

- Moderate gale: Deep reefed main + working jib
- Strong gale: Storm trysail + storm jib
- Severe gale: Storm jib alone or trysail alone
- Extreme: Bare poles

#### Jury-Rigged Storm Sails

If storm sails unavailable or lost:

- Deeply reefed working sails
- Anchor rode as preventer on boom
- Cut down damaged sails (last resort)
- Improvise from other sailcloth
- Use awnings or heavy canvas

### 3.7 Lee Shore Avoidance

**Definition**: A lee shore is land downwind of your position - the most dangerous situation in heavy weather.

#### Why Lee Shores are Critical Danger

**The Problem**:

- Wind and waves push vessel toward shore
- Leeway increases with wind strength
- Current often sets onto lee shore
- Worsening conditions reduce options
- Once too close, escape impossible
- Wrecking on shore is likely outcome

**Compounding Factors**:

- Reduced visibility makes position uncertain
- Exhausted crew makes poor decisions
- Equipment failures more likely in severe weather
- Anchoring often ineffective in storm conditions
- Engine may be inadequate against storm conditions

#### Prevention Strategies

**Advance Planning**:

- Study charts carefully before passage
- Identify all possible lee shores in various wind conditions
- Maintain extra sea room in threatening conditions
- Round exposed points with wide margin
- Don't enter confined waters when heavy weather forecast

**Early Action**:

- Tack away from lee shore at first sign of worsening conditions
- Motor if necessary while conditions still permit
- Accept slower progress to maintain sea room
- Never assume conditions won't worsen

**Distance Guidelines**:

- Maintain 20+ miles from lee shore in gale warnings
- 50+ miles in storm warnings
- Consider drift rate: 2 knots leeway = 48 miles in 24 hours
- Include safety margin for navigation errors

#### Escape Tactics

**If Caught on Lee Shore**:

*While Still Far Enough Off* (10+ miles):

1. Immediately tack onto offshore tack
2. Motor if possible to increase speed made good offshore
3. Accept enormous leeway - any offshore progress is success
4. Short tack if necessary to avoid shallow water
5. Absolute commitment to gaining sea room

*If Dangerously Close* (less than 5 miles):

1. Assess if clawing off is possible
2. Consider alternative: run along shore to find shelter
3. Look for protected anchorage or harbor
4. Emergency anchoring with all available ground tackle
5. Prepare for possible abandonment if wrecking imminent

**Anchoring as Last Resort**:

- Deploy all anchors
- Maximum scope possible
- Set stern anchor to reduce swinging
- All-hands monitoring
- Engine ready to assist
- Accept possibility of dragging - may only delay grounding
- Better to ground under some control than total wrecking

**Critical Decision Point**:
When to stop trying to claw off and seek alternative:

- No longer making offshore progress
- Crew exhaustion risking safety
- Equipment damage reducing capability
- Time running out before darkness/worsening conditions

#### Mental Discipline

**Avoiding the Trap**:

- Lee shores seduce sailors: calm water inshore, rough seas offshore
- Natural tendency to stay close to shore
- "Coastal reflex" - irrational attachment to sight of land
- Must overcome instinct and maintain sea room

**Recognition**:

- Question any decision that reduces sea room
- Second-guess "just a little closer"
- Err on side of excessive caution
- Remember: sea room can never be excessive

### 3.8 Crew Safety Procedures

**Primary Principle**: Crew safety is paramount. Damaged boat can be repaired; lost crew cannot.

#### Personal Safety Gear

**Harness and Tether**:

- Every crew member has dedicated harness
- Proper fit critical - must not slip off
- Tether: 6 feet working length, 3 feet for high-risk situations
- Double tether allows moving between attachment points
- Inspect regularly for chafe and wear
- Clip on before coming on deck in rough weather

**Jacklines**:

- Run full length of deck, port and starboard
- Webbing or wire rope, strongly attached at both ends
- Allow movement on deck while clipped in
- Position to keep crew inboard of lifelines
- High-strength attachment points

**Foul Weather Gear**:

- Full waterproof suit
- Integrated harness preferred
- High visibility colors
- Effective seals at neck, wrists, ankles
- Layers underneath for warmth
- Spare sets for watch rotation

**Personal Flotation**:

- Inflatable PFD with integrated harness
- Automatic and manual inflation
- Crotch strap essential (prevents riding up)
- Whistle and light attached
- PLB (Personal Locator Beacon) in pocket if available

#### Watchkeeping in Heavy Weather

**Watch System**:

- Shorten watches: 2-3 hours maximum in severe conditions
- Ensure adequate rest between watches
- Monitor crew for exhaustion and hypothermia
- Rotate demanding helming duties

**On-Watch Procedures**:

- Clip on before leaving companionway
- Move carefully, always with solid handhold
- Anticipate boat motion
- Never trust your footing alone
- Communicate intentions to watch mate

**Below Deck Safety**:

- Stay in bunk with lee cloth when off watch
- Secure all gear and equipment
- Prepare for knockdown: nothing loose
- Stay in center of boat (least motion)
- Wedge in position when working

#### Man Overboard Prevention

**Prevention is Only Option**:

- Recovery in storm conditions extremely difficult
- Survival time in cold water measured in minutes
- Breaking seas make location nearly impossible
- Prevention must be absolute priority

**Procedures**:

- Clip on when above deck - no exceptions
- Two hands for yourself, one for the ship
- Never go forward alone in heavy weather
- Work from cockpit when possible
- Brief crew before conditions deteriorate
- Establish buddy system

**High-Risk Activities**:

- Sail changes
- Working on foredeck
- Steering in following seas
- Navigation near bow pulpit
- Head use (wedge in position)

### 3.9 Damage Control Priorities

**Fundamental Principle**: Control damage quickly before it escalates. Small problems become catastrophic if ignored.

#### Priority Hierarchy

**1. Maintain Watertight Integrity**:

- Stop water ingress immediately
- Hull damage has absolute priority
- Stuffing box leaks
- Through-hull failures
- Portlight/hatch damage

**2. Preserve Rig**:

- Prevent dismasting if possible
- Reduce sail immediately if rigging damaged
- Support damaged stays with halyards
- Cut away flogging sails before damage spreads

**3. Maintain Steerage**:

- Rudder damage requires immediate jury-rig
- Protect steering system from further damage
- Prepare emergency steering before complete failure

**4. Preserve Crew Safety**:

- Treat injuries
- Prevent hypothermia
- Maintain morale
- Ensure rest and food

**5. Secondary Systems**:

- Engine
- Electronics
- Comfort items

#### Damage Control Equipment

**Essential Supplies**:

- Softwood plugs for every through-hull
- Collision mat or padding
- Epoxy putty
- Underwater epoxy
- Assorted hose clamps
- Extra line in various sizes
- Wire for lashing
- Strong tape (rigging tape, duct tape)
- Sheet metal screws
- Plywood for patches

**Tools Ready**:

- Bolt cutters (to cut rigging in emergency)
- Wire cutters
- Hacksaw with spare blades
- Drill with bits (manual and power)
- Hammer
- Assorted drivers and wrenches
- Vice grips

#### Common Damage Scenarios

**Taking on Water**:

1. Locate source immediately
2. Post crew to pump continuously
3. Stuff damage with cushions, bedding, sails
4. Secure collision mat over exterior if possible
5. Plug with softwood cone from interior
6. Apply epoxy putty if conditions permit
7. Continue monitoring and pumping

**Rigging Failure**:

1. Reduce sail immediately to reduce loads
2. Assess what has failed and implications
3. Support damaged areas with spare halyards
4. Run preventer if risk of further failure
5. Jury-rig replacement if possible
6. Adjust sail plan to minimize loads on damaged area

**Sail Damage**:

1. Drop damaged sail immediately before damage spreads
2. Secure flogging material
3. Assess if repair possible or sail unusable
4. Set alternative sail combination
5. Repair when conditions permit if possible

**Steering Failure**:

1. Attempt repairs if quick fix possible
2. Rig emergency tiller if available
3. Deploy jury steering (drogue, spinnaker pole rudder, or balance sails)
4. Reduce speed to improve jury steering effectiveness

#### Preparation

**Before Storm**:

- Inspect all systems
- Tighten rigging
- Check through-hulls
- Secure all deck gear
- Prepare damage control supplies
- Brief crew on procedures
- Review location of emergency equipment

**During Storm**:

- Regular inspection rounds
- Listen for unusual sounds
- Check bilges frequently
- Monitor rigging
- Feel for abnormal motion or vibration
- Early detection prevents escalation

## 4. Essential Seamanship Skills

### 4.1 Sail Trim and Balance

Proper sail trim and balance are critical for safety, speed, and control, especially in challenging conditions.

#### Understanding Center of Effort and Center of Lateral Resistance

**Center of Effort (CE)**:

- Combined center of all wind forces on sails
- Moves with sail adjustments
- Forward when jib dominant, aft when main dominant

**Center of Lateral Resistance (CLR)**:

- Center of hull's underwater lateral area
- Relatively fixed (changes slightly with heel)
- Pivot point of vessel

**Balance Relationship**:

- CE forward of CLR: Lee helm (boat wants to bear away)
- CE aft of CLR: Weather helm (boat wants to head up)
- Ideal: CE slightly aft of CLR (3-5° weather helm)

#### Weather Helm vs. Lee Helm

**Weather Helm** (pulling tiller to windward):

*Moderate weather helm (3-5°) is desirable*:

- Provides "feel" to helm
- Rudder works most efficiently
- Boat rounds up if helm released (safety feature)
- Natural tendency in most designs

*Excessive weather helm indicates*:

- Too much sail aft (reduce main)
- Heeling too much (reef)
- Mast rake too far aft
- Weight distribution too far aft
- Boat difficult to steer, rudder braking boat

**Lee Helm** (pushing tiller to leeward):

*Lee helm is generally undesirable*:

- Boat bears away if helm released (dangerous)
- Can lead to uncontrolled gybe
- Difficult to sail to windward
- Indicates poor balance

*Causes*:

- Too much sail forward (reduce jib)
- Mast raked too far forward
- Weight too far forward
- Center of effort too far forward

#### Correcting Helm Balance

**Reducing Weather Helm**:

*Sail Adjustments*:

1. Reef main first, before jib
2. Ease mainsheet and traveler to leeward
3. Tighten outhaul to flatten main
4. Tighten cunningham to move draft forward
5. Increase twist in main (ease vang, ease sheet)
6. Consider larger jib or smaller main long-term

*Weight Distribution*:

- Move weight aft to forward
- Reduce heel by reefing
- Crew weight to leeward and forward when overpowered

*Mast Adjustment*:

- Rake mast slightly forward if adjustable

**Correcting Lee Helm**:

*Sail Adjustments*:

1. Reef jib more than main
2. Trim main harder
3. Ease jib sheet
4. Ease outhaul to add power to main
5. Ease cunningham to move draft aft
6. Move jib lead forward

*Weight Distribution*:

- Move weight forward to aft
- Shift crew weight to windward

*Mast Adjustment*:

- Rake mast aft if adjustable

#### Upwind Sail Trim

**Mainsail**:

- Trim until just before luffing
- Use telltales on leech - top should stall first
- Moderate twist: top of sail less tight than bottom
- Flatten in heavy air (outhaul, cunningham, vang)
- Add power in light air (ease outhaul, cunningham)
- Traveler controls angle of attack without changing twist

**Headsail**:

- Trim to maintain slot between jib and main
- Lead position critical: controls twist and pointing
- Forward lead: Points higher, more twist
- Aft lead: More power, fuller shape, less pointing
- Ease in puffs, trim in lulls (keep boat on feet)

**Telltales**:

- Leeward and windward telltales flow together = perfect trim
- Leeward lifting: Sheet in or bear away
- Windward lifting: Sheet out or head up
- Top telltales stall first on jib = good twist

#### Downwind Sail Trim

**Running**:

- Boom perpendicular to wind
- Vang on to control twist
- Pole out jib on opposite side ("wing and wing")
- Watch for rolling - may need to sail by the lee or gybe
- Prevent accidental gybe with preventer

**Broad Reaching**:

- Most efficient downwind angle often 10-20° above dead run
- Increased speed overcomes less direct course
- Better sail shape and more control
- Less rolling motion

**Preventer**:

- Line from boom end to bow
- Prevents accidental gybe
- Essential for safety when running
- Release quickly if conditions require gybe
- Never use in storm conditions near lee shore (limits maneuverability)

### 4.2 Anchoring Techniques

Anchoring is a critical survival skill when harbors, marinas, or electronic navigation are unavailable.

#### Anchor Types and Selection

**Plow/CQR**:

- Good all-around performance
- Sets reliably in most bottoms
- Moderately good holding in sand, mud
- Larger size needed than newer designs

**Bruce/Claw**:

- Sets quickly
- Good in soft mud
- Less effective in hard sand or rock
- Reliable performer

**Danforth/Fluke**:

- Excellent holding in sand and mud
- Very high holding power-to-weight ratio
- Poor in rock or weed
- Can be difficult to retrieve if deeply buried

**Modern High-Efficiency (Rocna, Manson, Ultra)**:

- Superior holding power for weight
- Set reliably in most conditions
- Roll bar ensures proper orientation
- Expensive but recommended for survival situations

**Fisherman/Kedge**:

- Traditional design
- Good in rock and weed
- One fluke always up (can damage deck)
- Lower holding power than modern designs
- Useful as secondary/backup anchor

**Selection for Survival**:

- Primary: Modern high-efficiency anchor sized generously
- Secondary: Different type (Danforth if primary is plow, or vice versa)
- Storm anchor: Oversized primary-type anchor
- Lunch hook: Smaller anchor for temporary stops

#### Scope and Rode Requirements

**Scope Definition**: Ratio of rode length to depth at bow

**Minimum Scope Requirements**:

- All chain: 4:1 minimum, 5:1 preferred
- Chain + rope: 5:1 minimum, 7:1 preferred
- Storm conditions: 7:1 to 10:1
- All-rope rode: 8:1 to 10:1

**Why Scope Matters**:

- Shallow angle of pull increases holding
- Vertical pull can break anchor free
- More rode = more horizontal pull = better holding
- Weight of rode on bottom increases holding

**Rode Composition**:

*All Chain*:

- Maximum weight on bottom
- Superior chafe resistance
- Heavy and expensive
- Difficult to handle without windlass
- Excellent for extended anchoring

*Chain + Rope*:

- Chain leader: 6-20 feet protects against chafe
- Nylon rode: Provides elasticity, lighter, easier to handle
- Good compromise for cruising
- Requires chafe protection where rode passes through chocks

*All Rope*:

- Lightest option
- Requires longest scope
- Most elastic (good shock absorption)
- Vulnerable to chafe
- Acceptable for temporary anchoring

#### Anchoring Procedure

**Approach**:

1. Survey anchorage under sail/power
2. Select location with good holding, protection, swinging room
3. Note depth, bottom type, wind/current direction
4. Identify reference points ashore for checking drift
5. Plan approach heading into wind/current
6. Reduce speed to bare steerageway

**Setting Anchor**:

1. Stop vessel at selected spot
2. Lower anchor to bottom (don't throw)
3. Back down slowly as rode pays out
4. When desired scope reached, snub rode
5. Continue backing to set anchor firmly
6. Feel rode - should be bar-tight with some pulsing
7. Take bearings to shore objects or GPS position
8. Check for drag after 15 minutes and periodically

**Setting in Strong Wind**:

- Approach must be precise - wind will push vessel quickly
- Anchor must hit bottom at exact desired spot
- Pay out chain in sync with drift - don't dump on anchor
- Work quickly and smoothly - no second chances

**Checking for Dragging**:

- Bearings to shore objects change
- Feel rode - mushy or jerky indicates dragging
- Depth changes
- Vessel position on GPS/chart moves
- Wake or disturbance at anchor location
- Trust your instincts - if it feels wrong, reset

#### Multiple Anchor Techniques

**Bahamian Moor** (180° current/wind shifts):

1. Set primary anchor normally
2. Continue forward over anchor to double desired scope
3. Drop second anchor
4. Drop back to midpoint between anchors
5. Adjust rodes to equal tension
6. Both attached to bow
7. Boat swings between anchors as current reverses

**Two Anchors in Vee** (limited swinging room):

1. Set primary anchor normally
2. Back and to one side
3. Drop second anchor 45-60° from first
4. Adjust rodes to form Vee
5. Boat swings within narrower arc than single anchor

**Stern Anchor** (current parallel to wind):

1. Set bow anchor normally
2. Deploy stern anchor from dinghy or drop while backing
3. Take up bow rode while paying out stern rode
4. Adjust to desired position
5. Vessel held with minimal swinging
6. Essential for crowded anchorages or narrow channels

**Kedging Off** (if aground):

1. Load kedge anchor into dinghy
2. Row or motor in direction of deeper water
3. Drop anchor
4. Return to boat
5. Winch in anchor rode to pull boat toward anchor
6. Combine with heeling boat, reducing weight, waiting for tide

#### Storm Anchoring

See Section 3.6 for detailed storm anchoring techniques including:

- Three-anchor mooring systems
- Extended scope requirements
- Chafe protection critical importance
- Monitoring and watch procedures

**Key Points**:

- Oversized anchor (one or two sizes larger than normal recommendation)
- All-chain rode preferred
- Maximum scope (7:1 to 10:1)
- Multiple anchors for security
- Chafe protection at all contact points
- Long nylon snubber for shock absorption (30+ feet)
- Continuous watch
- Engine ready to power into gusts

### 4.3 Man Overboard Recovery Procedures

**CRITICAL**: Prevention is paramount. Recovery in heavy weather or at night is extremely difficult. In cold water or rough seas, recovery may be impossible.

#### Immediate Actions (Crew on Deck)

**1. Shout "Man Overboard!"** - Alert all crew immediately

**2. Throw Flotation**:

- Life ring/horseshoe buoy
- Dan buoy (pole with flag)
- Anything that floats and is easily seen
- Don't waste time with perfect throw - get flotation in water quickly

**3. Assign Spotter**:

- One person does NOTHING except point at person in water
- Never take eyes off person
- Call out position relative to boat
- This role is critical - person easily lost in waves

**4. Mark Position**:

- Press MOB button on GPS (if available)
- Note time
- Begin taking bearings if possible

**5. Begin Recovery Maneuver**:

- Decision on which method to use
- Execute immediately
- Don't deliberate - ACT

#### Recovery Methods Under Sail (No Motor)

**Quick Stop Method** (Preferred by most experts):

*Advantages*:

- Keeps vessel close to person in water
- Fastest method
- Works in most conditions
- Minimizes distance person drifts

*Procedure*:

1. Immediately head up into wind
2. Tack (or gybe if running)
3. Ease all sheets
4. Keep person on leeward side
5. Let boat drift toward person
6. When close, luff sails to slow
7. Approach from downwind
8. Stop alongside person

**Figure-8 Method**:

*Procedure*:

1. Immediately head to beam reach (6-8 boat lengths)
2. Tack
3. Bear away to broad reach briefly
4. Cross wake
5. Head up to close reach toward person
6. Ease sheets as you approach
7. Pick up person on leeward side
8. Speed under 1 knot at pickup

*Advantages*:

- Controlled approach
- Predictable pattern
- Easier to see person throughout

*Disadvantages*:

- Greater distance = more time
- Person drifts farther
- More difficult in heavy weather

**Heave-To Method**:

*Procedure*:

1. Immediately heave-to (back jib, lash helm)
2. Boat establishes stable drift pattern
3. Deploy retrieval system (lifesling, line)
4. Drift down toward person
5. Retrieve when in contact

*Advantages*:

- Very stable boat for recovery
- Works well shorthanded
- Time to prepare retrieval system

*Disadvantages*:

- Slower than other methods
- Depends on drift bringing you close
- May drift past person

#### Approach and Retrieval

**Final Approach**:

- ALWAYS approach from downwind
- Leeward side pickup provides wind/wave protection
- Speed less than 1 knot (slow walking pace)
- If you overshoot, luff sails and drift back
- Never circle back for second attempt - risks hitting person with boat

**Getting Person Aboard**:

*Conscious, Uninjured Person*:

1. Throw line with bowline loop
2. Person puts loop under arms
3. Crew hauls person to boat
4. Deploy boarding ladder or swim step
5. Person climbs aboard with assistance

*Hypothermic, Exhausted, or Injured*:

1. Lifesling is most effective (person places under arms, crew winches aboard)
2. Or lower large loop from halyard
3. Person steps in loop or sits in it
4. Winch person up and aboard
5. May require removing lifelines section

*For Heavy or Incapacitated Person*:

- Use main halyard or spinnaker halyard
- Attach to person's harness or lifting strop
- Winch vertically to bring aboard
- Very difficult without mechanical advantage
- May require boom as crane

**Severe Conditions**:

- Recovery becomes extremely difficult
- May need to motor to windward of person, deploy sea anchor, drift down
- Consider deploying life raft as recovery platform
- Multiple attempts may be necessary
- Crew safety on boat must not be compromised in recovery attempt

#### Prevention Measures

**Culture of Safety**:

- Harnesses clipped on - no exceptions in rough weather
- "One hand for the ship, one for yourself"
- Buddy system for forward deck work
- Night watches clipped in always
- Brief new crew on procedures

**Equipment**:

- Jacklines full length of deck
- Strong attachment points
- Harnesses for all crew
- Lifesling or similar retrieval system
- Dan buoy and life ring ready
- MOB pole with flag and light
- Recovery ladder or swim step

### 4.4 Collision Avoidance Without AIS/Radar

When electronic aids are unavailable, vigilant lookout and knowledge of collision regulations (COLREGS) are essential.

#### Rule 5: Lookout

"Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper lookout by sight and hearing"

**Practical Application**:

- Continuous visual scan of horizon (360°)
- Regular scan of entire visible area, not just ahead
- Listen for fog signals, engine noise, wave patterns
- Use binoculars to identify distant vessels
- Night: watch for navigation lights
- Multiple crew members maintain lookout

**Lookout Discipline**:

- Assign specific lookout duties on watch
- Helmsperson cannot be sole lookout
- Regular sector scans (ahead, quarters, astern)
- Report all vessels sighted
- Don't assume you've been seen

#### Rule 7: Risk of Collision

"Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt, such risk shall be deemed to exist."

**Determining Risk**:

- Take compass bearing to approaching vessel
- If bearing remains constant, risk of collision exists
- Even if bearing changes, large vessels or close range may still have collision risk
- Assumptions shall not be made based on scanty information

**Compass Bearing Method**:

1. Take bearing to vessel when first sighted
2. Note time
3. Take bearing again after several minutes
4. If bearing unchanged: collision risk exists
5. If bearing changing forward: you will pass ahead
6. If bearing changing aft: vessel will pass ahead

#### Rule 8: Action to Avoid Collision

**Key Principles**:

- Action must be in ample time
- Alterations must be large and obvious (readily apparent to other vessel)
- Succession of small alterations should be avoided
- Take action early enough to pass at safe distance

**Practical Guidelines**:

- Alter course by at least 30° if possible
- Change speed significantly (not just 1 knot)
- Continue action until well past and clear
- Monitor to ensure action is effective

#### Sailing Vessel Right-of-Way Rules

**Rule 12 - Two Sailing Vessels**:

*When on opposite tacks*:

- Port tack vessel keeps clear of starboard tack vessel
- Windward side is side opposite to mainsail
- Memory: "Starboard tack has right of way"

*When on same tack*:

- Windward vessel keeps clear of leeward vessel
- Windward = upwind
- Leeward = downwind

*When in doubt*:

- Port tack vessel assumes other vessel is on starboard tack
- Must keep clear

**Rule 13 - Overtaking**:

- Overtaking vessel keeps clear
- Applies regardless of propulsion type
- Overtaking = approaching from more than 22.5° abaft beam
- Remains overtaking vessel until completely past and clear

**Rule 18 - Power vs. Sail**:

- Power gives way to sail (general rule)
- Exceptions: Sail must keep clear of:
  - Vessel not under command
  - Vessel restricted in ability to maneuver
  - Vessel engaged in fishing
  - Large vessel in narrow channel
- Sailing vessel under power counts as power vessel

#### Restricted Visibility (Rule 19)

**When Vessels Not in Sight of Each Other**:

- Proceed at safe speed adapted to conditions
- Take action on hearing fog signal
- Every vessel ready to maneuver immediately
- Avoid if possible:
  - Altering to port for vessel forward of beam
  - Altering toward vessel abeam or abaft beam

**Sound Signals in Fog** (Rule 35):

- Sailing vessel: 1 long + 2 short blasts every 2 minutes
- Power vessel making way: 1 long blast every 2 minutes
- Power vessel stopped: 2 long blasts every 2 minutes
- Listen continuously for other vessels

**Safe Speed in Fog**:

- Ability to stop in half the visible distance
- Allow time to assess situation and take action
- Consider sea state, visibility, traffic density
- May need to slow to bare steerageway or stop

#### Night Navigation

**Light Recognition**:

- Port (red) and Starboard (green) sidelights: 112.5° arc
- Stern light (white): 135° arc astern
- Masthead light (white): 225° arc ahead (power vessels)
- Sailing vessel under sail: sidelight + stern only (no masthead)

**Determining Aspect**:

- Both sidelights visible: Heading toward you
- One sidelight: Crossing
- Stern light only: Heading away
- Masthead light: Power vessel

**Taking Action**:

- Earlier action than daytime (harder to judge speed/distance)
- Large course alterations more obvious at night
- Use searchlight to illuminate sails if needed
- Ensure your lights are visible and correct

### 4.5 Emergency Steering Methods

See Section 3.4 (Jury Rigging Emergency Steering Techniques) for comprehensive coverage of:

- Drogue steering systems
- Pole-and-board jury rudders
- Drag device steering
- Sail balance steering
- Emergency tiller systems

**Key Points for Survival**:

- Practice at least one method before need arises
- Maintain equipment needed for jury steering
- Accept reduced boat speed for effectiveness
- Each boat responds differently - customize approach
- Preparation and practice are critical

### 4.6 Jury Rigging Techniques

**Philosophy**: Jury rigging means improvising repairs or replacements for damaged or lost equipment using available materials.

#### Replacing Halyards

**If Main Halyard Lost or Jammed**:

- Spinnaker halyard to raise main
- Spare halyard (if available)
- Attach to head with shackle
- Reeve line through block at masthead
- Fashion new halyard from spare line
- Send crew aloft if possible to retrieve or replace

**If Jib Halyard Lost**:

- Spare halyard
- Hoist on main halyard with jury attachment
- Use tack pennant to raise tack higher
- Reduce headsail size if necessary

#### Temporary Rigging Repairs

**Shroud Failure**:

1. Immediately reduce sail to reduce mast loading
2. Tack to put failed shroud on leeward side
3. Run spare halyard to deck at position of failed shroud
4. Tension with winch or tackle
5. Secure to strong point
6. Reduce sail on side with damage
7. Sail conservatively to minimize loads

**Forestay Failure**:

1. DO NOT tack - mast may fall
2. Deploy jib halyard to bow
3. Tension hard to replace forestay
4. Set inner forestay if available
5. Run additional halyards forward if needed
6. Sail downwind to reduce forward loads
7. Consider dropping mast if failure imminent

**Boom Failure**:

1. Drop mainsail immediately
2. Boom may be swinging dangerously - secure
3. Options:
   - Set trysail (doesn't use boom)
   - Lash spinnaker pole as replacement boom
   - Hoist main loose-footed without boom
4. Reduce sail area if control is compromised

#### Sail Repairs at Sea

**Small Tears**:

- Adhesive sail repair tape on both sides
- Sew with needle and thread if conditions permit
- Zigzag stitching across tear
- Reinforce with tape after sewing

**Large Tears or Blown Seams**:

- Drop sail immediately before damage spreads
- Sew seams or patch large tears below deck
- May require hours of hand-sewing
- Use sail as pattern to cut patch from spare material
- Tape can be temporary measure until sewing possible

**Batten Pockets**:

- Often fail in heavy weather
- Sew or tape closed
- Remove batten if pocket unusable

#### Jury Rudder

See Section 3.4 for detailed jury rudder techniques.

#### Mast Damage

**Bent Mast** (still standing):

- Reduce sail immediately
- Identify location of bend
- Adjust rigging to straighten if possible
- Support with halyards from both sides
- Sail conservatively
- May need to cut away and jury-rig if failure imminent

**Dismasting**:

1. Immediate priorities:
   - Prevent hull damage from flogging rigging
   - Prevent through-hull damage
   - Secure crew safety
2. Cut away rigging if necessary (bolt cutters essential)
3. Recover usable materials if possible
4. Jury-rig replacement if conditions permit:
   - Spinnaker pole as mast
   - Boom as mast
   - A-frame or tripod arrangement
5. Fashion small sail area for stability and progress
6. Navigate to nearest port using engine and/or jury sail

- Teenagers (13-17): Navigation basics, sail handling, watch standing
- Adults: Full range of skills including celestial navigation and heavy weather

**Shared Learning Activities**:

- Celestial navigation practice (all can take sights)
- Chart plotting exercises
- Man overboard drills
- Storm preparation checklists
- Weather observation routines

### 7.4 Progressive Skill Building

**Start with Foundation**:

1. Coastal cruising with electronic backup
2. Regular practice of traditional skills
3. Gradual increase in passage length
4. Progressive exposure to challenging conditions

**Build to Independence**:
