Done: `git reset --hard HEAD` worked and has brought us into a more tractable position.

I had forgotten about this worktree/branch when updating main, and now I am trying to gracefully prepare the changes here (plan-omega.templates branch) for eventual merge back to main.

There is a complicating factor. There was extensive corruption due to extended characters. All the files in main have been fixed, and the files here need to likewise be fixed before merge back to main. Details in git and at  
~/src/plan-omega/EXTENDED-CHARACTER-REMEDIATION.md

How would you recommend I go about merging a fixed main into this feature branch?

- merge first (fix stash pop conflicts, then remediate extended character corruption)
- extended character remediation first, then merge in main, fix conflicts, merge feature branch up to main
- something else?

Please assess and generate a plan.
